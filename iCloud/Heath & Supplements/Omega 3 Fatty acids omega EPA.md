Peter likes this brand

carlsons omega 3

Avoid ethyl ester form

Want dark bottle to prevent

Want largest brands - higher turnover so less rancid

Don't get too long supply, so it doesn't go rancid.

Smaller fish are better due to less build up of toxins like mercury, etc.

Algae oil has a different ratio of oils compared to fish or krill oil
