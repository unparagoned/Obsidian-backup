# Importance of sleep
## Lack of sleep is terrible for your health

There is some evidence that suggest the sleep is causally related to cardiovascular disease. 

>Sleep is a foundational element of human biology and  a requirement for life....Numerous epidemiological  studies have identified poor habitual sleep as a risk factor for all-cause mortality, and subsequent research  has explored potential mechanisms, including implications for cardiometabolic health...Much of the existing research has focused on sleep  duration, although it should be noted that sleep health  is a multidimensional construct withoverlapping components, including duration, timing, regularity, efficiency... there is a paucity of evidence indicating that  improving sleep duration or quality reduces CVD incidence... a limited number  of studies demonstrate that real-world sleep manipulation is associated with changes in CVD-related risk factors.

>Sleep restriction is associated with increased cardiovascular risk, which is more pronounced in female than male persons. We reported recently first **causal evidence that mild, prolonged sleep restriction mimicking “real-life” conditions impairs endothelial function**, a key step in the development and progression of cardiovascular disease, in healthy female persons.

Sleep is linked to all sorts of health issues like depression and dementia, much of it causally.

It might be that it takes a long time to get over a bad night of sleep, but I don't think that's right. Some of the damage done by a bad night of sleep is permanent and irreversible and will never be undone. The amount during a single night of bad sleep is soo small it's undetectable but if it happens a lot it will start to add up over the years. 

>Man who didn't sleep for a record 264 hours suffered from crippling effects for years after

Two nights of sleep isn't enough to recover from lack of sleep. I suspect that people that say they have to have an alarm clock to wake up otherwise they would sleep 10h+ each night, are just chronically sleep deprived and it might take quite a few days of 10h+ sleep to recover. It's not that 10h+ is their natural sleep length. 

>HR and SBP did not recover to baseline levels after two recovery nights of sleep, suggesting that longer recovery sleep may be necessary to recover from multiple, consecutive nights of moderate sleep restriction.

# How much sleep do you need

The actual amount of sleep you need depends on what you did that day. If you spent all day doing vigorous training or a lot of manual labour, you might need ten hours of sleep, on the other hand, if you just spent it in front of Netflix you might only need eight hours of sleep. Which is why I recommend you just wake up naturally once you've had enough sleep.

Your probably shouldn't be using an alarm to wake yourself up, alarms by definition will wake you up when your body still thinks you needs more sleep plus it's usually in the middle of sleep cycle which can make you feel particularly groggy. Plus alarm clocks are quite stressful for the body. Sure use an alarm clock to tell you when to get out of bed or as a backup, but you should be going to sleep early enough that you wake up naturally once you've had enough sleep. Also using the snooze button just leads to more stress on the body and poor quality sleep.



There is a U shape mortality curve when it comes to how much you sleep, and I would say that half of that is causal and the other half is reverse causation. So if you are getting less than 7-8h of sleep then that has a negative effect on your mortality. If you are getting lots of sleep then that probably means you are ill or have some kind of health issue and your body needs as much sleep as possible to fight the illness. If say your have easy stages of cancer or something and are getting 10h of sleep that will contribute to higher mortality rates. But if you told those people sleeping 10h to sleep only 7-8h of sleep where overall mortality is minimised they are going to have even higher mortality rates. Also people with say sleep apnea which interrupts their sleep, have bodies which is making them sleep longer to try and makeup for the poor quality sleep. If you told these people to get less actual sleep that would be bad for them

>In general, sleep duration is associated with mortality in a U-shaped fashion, such that the lowest risk is most often found in the group who report sleep durations of 7–8 hours
[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2856739/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2856739/)

Sleep stages change overnight, missing say 20% of sleep might result in 50% loss in REM sleep, etc.

They showed that chronic restriction of sleep to 6h a night was equivalent to 2 nights of total sleep deprivation, and the worse thing is they don't realise how impaired they are.

>Since chronic restriction of sleep to 6 h or less per night produced cognitive performance deficits equivalent to up to 2 nights of total sleep deprivation, it appears that even relatively moderate sleep restriction can seriously impair waking neurobehavioral functions in healthy adults. Sleepiness ratings suggest that subjects were largely unaware of these increasing cognitive deficits, which may explain why the impact of chronic sleep restriction on waking cognitive functions is often assumed to be benign.
>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12683469/


Most short sleepers have smaller brain volumes. However there are some short sleepers that feel fine during the day and don't show smaller brain volumes, but they do have slightly lower cognitive abilities.

>In conclusion, some people sleep ≤6 h without showing lower regional brain volumes, despite sleeping within a range where smaller regional brain volumes are expected. Hence, short sleep is not necessarily associated with negative structural brain outcomes. In contrast, short sleepers showed slightly lower general cognitive abilities,
>https://www.jneurosci.org/content/43/28/5241


## Naps

I think naps do have some benefits, but they don't make up for poor or lack of sleep. 

>Can coffee or a nap make up for sleep deprivation? A psychologist explains why there’s no substitute for shut-eye
Importantly, we found that participants who napped [did no better](https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/zsab152) on either the simple attention task or the more complex placekeeping task than those who stayed up all night.
Thus, a nap in the middle of the night had no discernible benefits to cognitive performance during the morning after a night of overall sleep deprivation.

# Determinants of sleep quality

## Regularity

Your body is supposed to work on a fairly regular schedule. Your circadian rhythm should be strong and it sets things in motion for when they should happen. 

So your body releases hormones and stuff before and when you should be alseep according to your circadian rhythm, not just when you go to sleep. So your body will be primed and release hormones for your normal bedtime, and if you go to sleep later you won't get all the benefits even if you sleep for as long. 


>These results confirm the considerable influence of sleep in driving the GH rhythm and the existence of a circadian influence revealed by an acute shift in the sleep period. They also provide evidence of an incomplete adjustment of GH rhythms in night workers.
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9042551/

Regularity is more important than duration

>These findings indicate that sleep regularity is an important predictor of mortality risk and is a stronger predictor than sleep duration.

## Light
#light 

Ideally you want to see the sunrise when you wake up, it's the wavelengths that play key role. If that's not possible any sunlight or a SAD lamp. In the morning your eyes aren't sensitive so you need a lot of light. Windows block the key wavelengths so you need to be outdoors. And even if it's overcast there is way more Lux than any lightbulb can provide.

In the evening it's the opposite your eyes are particularly sensitive to light. So you want to avoid bright lights, blue in particular. You have specific receptors in the eye that aren't linked to vision which are sensitive to blue light. So even some blind people might benefit from sunlight in the morning and avoiding bright lights in the evening. There is some controversy around the blue light stuff, and some people think it's just the stimulating activity of computers and phones, which is the problem. Maybe avoid both to be safe.

Then you want your room to be pitch black at night, stick tape over any LEDs or anything. 

If you need to check the time then asking something like Alexa is good since you avoid movement or bright light exposure from clocks/phones. 

[[Sleep - Bad types -  Night owls, Bimodal#Light exposure]]

>This study captured ~13 million hours of data from light sensors worn by ~89,000 individuals who were over 40 y of age. Those with brighter nights and darker days had higher risk of premature mortality,
https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2405924121


>The researchers found that reading on a smartphone without a blue-light filter significantly suppressed melatonin levels in both adolescents and young adults. However, adolescents showed a faster recovery in melatonin levels before bedtime, whereas adults still exhibited significantly reduced melatonin levels at bedtime. This melatonin suppression effect was less pronounced when participants used a blue-light filter or read from a printed book.
[https://www.psypost.org/exposure-to-smartphone-light-suppresses-melatonin-levels-at-night/](https://www.psypost.org/exposure-to-smartphone-light-suppresses-melatonin-levels-at-night/



## Screen time

>increased screen time in bed is linked to poorer sleep
>https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychiatry/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2025.1548273/full
## Temperature

Temperature is a major factor in your circadian rhythm, after you wake up your temperature will increase and peak during the day, then decrease when it comes time to sleep.

Having a hot bath or shower in the evening, results in vasodilation which let's your body then cool down faster. So paradoxically a hot bath in the evening allows your body to to cool down which helps with sleep.

General cold water baths can help with sleep, not this isn't related to just before you sleep but in general. Some people have them before they sleep but others find them too stimulating.

>Two weeks of regular therapeutic CWI improved sleep, with fewer sleep disturbances reported.
>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031938424002762

## Diet

A healthy diet is good. Some people say that avoiding a big meal close to be bed helps, others say a high carb meal helps.

Having breakfast is optimal, some studies say within 1-2h of waking, other people suggest waiting 1-2h for melatonin to drop. 


>This large epidemiological study revealed a statistically significant association between UPF intake and chronic insomnia
[https://www.jandonline.org/article/S2212-2672(24)00094-7/fulltext](https://www.jandonline.org/article/S2212-2672\(24\)00094-7/fulltext)

In animals we have well established the mechanisms and fact that diet impacts sleep

>We also found that the CCHa1 pathway, while critical for gating mechanosensory information, has no influence on how easily the flies wake up when exposed to heat, suggesting that different sensory modalities such as vibration and temperature can be gated independently. Finally, we showed that a higher protein diet also improved the quality of sleep in mice, making them more resistant to mechanical disturbances.
[https://hms.harvard.edu/news/untangling-mystery-sleep](https://hms.harvard.edu/news/untangling-mystery-sleep)

Timing early is better. 

>Thus, having an early morning breakfast is essential for maintaining the synchronization of central and peripheral clocks and promoting metabolic homeostasis. Moreover, breakfast also appears to be important for having a good night’s sleep, which in turn can contribute to earlier bedtimes and rise times and promote a healthier circadian rhythm.
https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10528427/


We show that the responsiveness of sleeping flies and mice to mechanical vibrations is better suppressed when the diet is protein rich.

>Higher protein concentration in the gut leads to increased activity of enteroendocrine cells that release the peptide CCHa1. CCHa1 signals to a small group of dopamine neurons in the brain to modulate their activity; the dopaminergic activity regulates the behavioral responsiveness of animals to vibrations. The CCHa1 pathway and dietary proteins do not influence responsiveness to all sensory inputs, showing that during sleep, different information streams can be gated through independent mechanisms.

### Caffeine

I used to recommend no caffeine after 11am but a single large European size coffee early in the morning still significantly impacted sleep that night. Some people also suggest avoiding decaf coffee after 11am since it still contains some caffeine.

 >To further investigate the role of adenosine in sleep regulation we administered 200 mg of caffeine at 07.10 h and analyzed the sleep stages and EEG power spectra during the subsequent night in nine healthy men. Caffeine levels in saliva decreased from a maximum of 17 μmol/l one hour after intake, to 3 μmol/l immediately prior to the sleep episode starting at 23.00 h. Compared to placebo, sleep efficiency and total sleep time were significantly reduced.

>Caffeine is thought to block the cell receptors that adenosine (a substance in the brain) uses to trigger its sleep-inducing signals

## Physical activity linked to sleep

Studies show that for sleep, the best time to exercise is in the morning. Intense physical activity at night can negatively impact sleep.

>This nationwide study observed an inverse association of gardening with multiple sleep complaints and several individual sleep complaints, in a dose-response manner.
[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165032724005263](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165032724005263)

>Our findings suggest that exercise can improve sleep quality without notable adverse effects
>Recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have confirmed that exercise has positive effects on sleep quality, sleep onset latency, total sleep time, sleep efficiency, and insomnia severity ([Passos et al., 2010](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6045928/#ref-54); [Reid et al., 2010](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6045928/#ref-58); [Hartescu, Morgan & Stevinson, 2015](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6045928/#ref-26)).
[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6045928/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6045928/)

>If exercising within a four-hour window of bedtime, people could choose brief low-intensity exercises, such as a light jog or swim, to minimize sleep disruption and allow the body to wind down," he said.

## Drugs
#betablockers #propranolol

Beta-blockers can impair sleep

>Night recordings of muscle tension, eye movement, heart rate and electroencephalogram were recorded on paper and magnetic tape. Analysis of the subjective questionnaires showed that recollection of dreaming and awakening in the night was increased by the three lipophilic drugs, propranolol, metoprolol, and pindolol. These results confirm reports in the literature but are contrary to those expected from considering the effects of noradrenaline on sleep. Analysis of physiological records confirmed subjects' reports that waking was increased by the lipophilic drugs. Dreaming (rapid eye movement sleep, REM) was reduced, as predicted from knowledge of the effect of noradrenaline on sleep. Increased awakening leads to an increase in remembered dreaming which explains the otherwise paradoxical results.

# Treatments for insomnia

[[Sleep#Determinants of sleep quality]] are key but these are additional things for people with insomnia, etc.

First port of call would probably be sleep hygiene and CBTI, which have been shown to be as good as pills. I'm not sure as good as pills is the right to describe it since pills don't induce good quality sleep. 

## CBT-i

CBT-i is very successful and those that it doesn't work for didn't adhere to it.

>CBT-i produces results that are equivalent to sleep medication, with no side effects, fewer episodes of relapse, and a tendency for sleep to continue to improve long past the end of treatment.
[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6796223/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6796223/)

>In a randomised controlled trial, 57 participants with insomnia disorder were given either cognitive therapy (CT) or mindfulness-based therapy (MBT) ... The results suggest that changes in cognitive processes are especially important in treating insomnia, and that there are different therapeutic modalities through which this can be achieved.

# Sleep aids

## Apps

Calm
Headspace

This circadian calculator seems like an OK calculator. I'm sure you can tweak the timings, but the key thing is to keep things regular day in and day out.
[SleepSyncer - Optimize Your Sleep & Sync Your Schedule 🌙](https://confusedamanager.github.io/sleep-syncer-sleep-cycle-calculator/#home)

## Mental

### Mediation

Mediation can help you sleep, you can also use apps like Calm or Headspace.

Yoga nidra(Non-sleep deep rest) have physical benefits. If say you have insomnia then I think it's probably good to focus just on the benefits of doing yoga nidra in bed knowing that even if you don't get any sleep your are getting some of the benefits. 

### Military relation technique

1. Relax the muscles in your face, including tongue, jaw and the muscles around the eyes
2. Drop your shoulders as far down as they’ll go, followed by your upper and lower arm, one side at a time
3. Breathe out, relaxing your chest followed by your legs, starting from the thighs and working down
4. You should then spend 10 seconds trying to clear your mind before thinking about one of the three following images:

- You’re lying in a canoe on a calm lake with nothing but a clear blue sky above you
- You’re lying in a black velvet hammock in a pitch-black room
- You say “don’t think, don’t think, don’t think” to yourself over and over for about 10 seconds.

### Cognitive Shuffle

The approach moves you from of a high state of alertness, towards drifting off to sleep. Cognitive shuffling scrambles your thoughts so that your brain can't try to make sense of things. It interrupts the processes of memory, evaluation, planning, scheduling and problem solving.

Here's how it's done.  
1. Pick a word such as "bedtime".
2. Begin with the first letter "b" and think of a word that starts with the letter "b". For example "broom". Bring up the mental image of a broom. Then think of another word that begins with the letter "b" and visualise that word. Keep going until you run out of words that begin with the letter "b".
3. Go to the next letter in "bedtime" - "e", and think of words that begin with "e". Visualise the words as you think of them.
4. Continue at your own pace, but just keep going until you fall asleep. Dr Beaudoin recommends if stressful thoughts come your way, just acknowledge them and go back to shuffling your thoughts instead.
5. An additional tip: Breathe in as you come up with the word. Breathe out as you visualise the word. If it takes longer to visualise the word, you'll be giving yourself lovely long out breaths which will calm your body.

## Supplements





Magnesium threonate  - This has more effect in those that are mag deficient, threonate passes blood brain barrier others may just relax muscles which does help
help allow increased gaba

Apigenin

L-theanine

>L-theanine promotes relaxation and facilitates sleep by contributing to a number of changes in the brain:
>- **Boosts levels of GABA and other calming brain chemicals:** L-theanine elevates levels of [GABA](https://sleepdoctor.com/pages/sleep-aids/gaba), as well as serotonin and dopamine. These chemicals are known as neurotransmitters, and they work in the brain to regulate emotions, mood, concentration, alertness, and sleep, as well as appetite, energy, and other cognitive skills. Increasing levels of these calming brain chemicals promotes relaxation and can help with sleep.
>- **Lowers levels of “excitatory” brain chemicals:** At the same time it is increasing chemicals that promote feelings of calm, L-theanine also reduces levels of chemicals in the brain that are linked to [stress and anxiety](https://sleepdoctor.com/pages/health). This may also be a way that L-theanine can protect brain cells against stress and age-related damage.
>- **Enhances alpha brain waves:** Alpha brain waves are associated with a state of “wakeful relaxation.” That’s the state of mind you experience when meditating, being creative, or letting your mind wander in daydreaming. Alpha waves are also present during REM sleep. L-theanine appears to trigger the release of alpha-waves, which enhances relaxation, focus, and creativity.

Montmorency Tart Cherry - For DOMS & sleep

# Drugs

I would never use a drug long term, but as a last resort they might be helpful in the short term for breaking a circuit. 

People often take sedatives since they think being sedated into unconsciousness is the same thing as sleep. But in some stages of sleep your brain is more active in some aspects than when you are awake. So in some respects sedation into unconsciousness is the opposite state as sleep. So some people might feel groggy after taking a sleeping pill the morning after, and that might not be cause the sleeping pill is still working, but might be because you didn't actually get a good night sleep.

Pretty much all the sleeping pills are linked to dementia, from anti-histamines you can pick off the shelf to Z-drugs your doctor prescribes and anti-psychotics(pharma companies have paid billions in fines relating to pushing this but doctors still irresponsibly prescribe them for insomnia). The only exception are DORA drugs which might actually help clear amyloid(but a big warning, I don't think we can trust any study relating to DORA drugs, see below)

I used to recommend DORA drugs for sleep since they are supposed to preserve your sleep architecture, but I was told by an insider that unpublished data they saw suggested otherwise. They seemed very knowledgable and I'm included to believe them. 
### Alcohol

Alcohol is a sedative - it disrupts some stages of sleep
Also there is a rebound effect when it wares off which can disrupt sleep and cause awakaning.

#### Melatonin

I think there is some evidence of this helping older adults or if you are jet-lagged. But I wouldn’t use it regularly; it's a powerful hormone that is a key factor in puberty and has effects on your reproductive organs. So kids/teenagers should probably steer clear. In most developed countries it's prescription-only, so I would only consider it after speaking to a doctor.

#### Antihistamines

>Promethazine showed a dose related REM-depressing effect with a greater decrease, the higher the dose
[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/171695/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/171695/)


>The effects of Benadryl on sleep quality and REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep are noteworthy. While it can help induce sleep, research suggests that it may alter sleep architecture, potentially reducing the amount of time spent in REM sleep. REM sleep is crucial for cognitive functions such as memory consolidation and learning, so this alteration in sleep patterns is an important consideration.  [https://neurolaunch.com/benadryl-for-sleep/](https://neurolaunch.com/benadryl-for-sleep/)

>Zolpidem used might be associated with increased risk for dementia in elderly population. Increased accumulative dose might have higher risk to develop dementia, especially in patients with underlying diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, and stroke.
[https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4603066/](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4603066/)

>The scientists also found that the sleep drug zolpidem, better known as Ambien, impedes the blood vessel oscillations and the fluid flow they promote, implying it could hamper cleansing.

>On the contrary, the sleep aid zolpidem suppressed norepinephrine oscillations and glymphatic flow, highlighting the critical role of norepinephrine-driven vascular dynamics in brain clearance.

#### DORA

>FWIW, I don't generally comment in such a vague way but I am bound by NDA in this case. Nothing nefarious--simply an agreement that I signed. I doubt that I would be "caught" either, but I try to be a person of their word. What I have seen, datawise, is suggestive that it is important to understand that (a) OX1 and OX2R indeed subserve differential functions vis-a-vis REM and non-REM sleep and (b) when both antagonized (in combination), adverse events may be more likely--even though the clinical profile of a dual (OX1+2) antagonist is probably superior to that of, say, Ambien.
>In plain English, specificity matters. A quick drill-down into the OX1 and 2 literature from 2009-2015 is actually pretty illuminating whereas the later stuff (2017-2020) is less convincing, at least to someone who has seen raw data... This seems counterintuitive, I know. Disinformation be like that.
>Dual antagonists absolutely will knock you out, but somewhat at the expense of sleep architecture, whereas more specific antagonism will better preserve REM vs NREM (at least in rats) but with less efficacy that dual. In my view.

#### Antipsychotics - major tranquillisers - mood stabilisers 
#seroquel #olanzapine 

Major tranquillizers like quetiapine and olanzapine are typically used to treat conditions like schizophrenia and will knock you out(maybe not in the right way). It is thought that in low doses, they act as anti-histamines making you drowsy. Doctors probably shouldn’t be prescribing these for insomnia. The drug companies behind them have been fined billions for pushing off-label use to treat insomnia(and hundreds of millions more related to the dangers of the side effects).


### Cannabis

## Why we sleep

Great book and podcasts, but some people have issues with what he said, so don't take it as gospel. But most of the advice is probably spot on. If you look at the critics it's the usual Reddit I don't like the idea that my own behaviours around sleep could be negatively impacting my health, so I'll nitpick and find any issue I can with it. If you look at any Reddit post about a study showing the exercise, sleep or good diet is good for your health, most the time the top comment will always be one finding issues with it. 



# Mechanisms 

Add Sin(adenosoine) to coffee to stay awake

>adenosine, builds up in your blood while you’re awake. Then, while you sleep, your body breaks down the adenosine.
[https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/files/docs/public/sleep/healthy_sleep.pdf](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/files/docs/public/sleep/healthy_sleep.pdf)


>We identified a gene that codes for a molecule called CCHa1. When we depleted CCHa1 in the flies, they woke up very easily — so instead of 20 percent waking up at a particular level of vibration, 90 percent woke up.
However, while CCHa1 is present in both the nervous system and the gut, it was only when we depleted it in the gut that flies were roused more easily. The cells in the gut that produce CCHa1 are called enteroendocrine cells, and they actually share many characteristics with neurons and can even connect and communicate with neurons. These cells face the inside of the gut, and they sort of “taste” the contents of the gut.
We found that the higher concentration of protein in the diet, the more CCHa1 these gut cells produced. This molecule then travels from the gut to the brain, where it signals to a small group of dopaminergic neurons that also receive information about vibrations. These neurons produce dopamine, which usually promotes arousal, but in this case suppresses arousal. Vibrations weaken the activity of the dopaminergic neurons, which causes the flies to wake up more easily. CCHa1 produced by the gut essentially buffers the dopaminergic neurons against vibrations, allowing the flies to ignore the environment to a greater degree and sleep more deeply.

# Notes



## Timing

The earlier stages of sleep are based on time, so if you go to sleep late you just miss them. So hormone releases, etc.

Then since sleep stages change overnight, missing say 20% of sleep might result in 50% loss in REM sleep, etc.
