Our results show that the consumption of either NPJ or HPJ protected against DNA damage and lipid peroxidation, modified several antioxidant enzymes, and reduced body weight in overweight or obese nonsmoking adults.

Chronic daily consumption of flavanone-rich 100% orange juice over 8 wk is beneficial for cognitive function in healthy older adults. The potential for flavanone-rich foods and drinks to attenuate cognitive decline in aging and the mechanisms that underlie these effects should be investigated.

Moderate consumption of whole apples is associated with a reduced risk of all-cause death in patients with hypertension, whereas apple juice and sauce may increase the risk of death.

## Method of action

GLP-1 Receptor Activation

- Enhances Insulin Secretion:  
    When GLP-1 receptors are activated, they boost insulin secretion from the pancreatic beta cells, but only when blood glucose levels are elevated. This helps lower post-meal blood sugar levels without causing hypoglycemia.
- Suppresses Glucagon:  
    GLP-1 activation reduces glucagon secretion from the alpha cells, which in turn helps decrease the liver’s glucose production.
- Delays Gastric Emptying:  
    By slowing down the rate at which food leaves the stomach, GLP-1 receptor activation contributes to a more gradual increase in blood glucose after meals.
- Promotes Satiety:  
    GLP-1 also acts on the brain to enhance feelings of fullness, which can lead to reduced food intake and subsequent weight loss.
- Receptors in the brain around appetite
- Decreases ghrelin.

GIP Receptor Activation

- Boosts Insulin Response:  
    GIP normally works to potentiate insulin secretion after meals. Although its effectiveness can be diminished in type 2 diabetes, tirzepatide’s activation of the GIP receptor appears to restore and even enhance this effect.
- Potential Metabolic Benefits:  
    While the full role of GIP in metabolism is still being explored, evidence suggests that its activation may also improve insulin sensitivity and contribute to beneficial effects on lipid metabolism.
- Receptors in the brain around appetite.
