I used to recommend no caffeine after 11am but a single large European size coffee early in the morning still significantly impacted sleep that night. Some people also suggest avoiding decaf coffee after 11am since it still contains some caffeine. But caffeine has lots of health benefits. So maybe up to three 10 hours before sleep might be a good balance. 

 >To further investigate the role of adenosine in sleep regulation we administered 200 mg of caffeine at 07.10 h and analyzed the sleep stages and EEG power spectra during the subsequent night in nine healthy men. Caffeine levels in saliva decreased from a maximum of 17 μmol/l one hour after intake, to 3 μmol/l immediately prior to the sleep episode starting at 23.00 h. Compared to placebo, sleep efficiency and total sleep time were significantly reduced.
