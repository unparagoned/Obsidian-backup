Looking at the LD50 of a substance is a terrible metric to say whether something is healthy or not. 

Like do you think that the LD50 for transfat is meaningful for what a healthy amount is to consume? I'm pretty sure the LD50 for transfats is massive, way beyond anything a human would ever consume. Doesn't in any way mean that the amount of transfats that used to be in UPF was anyway not unhealthy.
