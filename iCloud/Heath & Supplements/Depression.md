Depression is an umbrella term for a variety of conditions some psychological and some physical, with complex feedback loops between biological and environmental aspects. Someone with a biologically impaired brained might not be able to cope with normal stressors in life. 

The brain is just part of the body and needs good diet, sleep and exercise to function properly.  Exercise increases levels of BDNF, increases brain volume, improves brain connectivity, improves brain vascularity, improves brain mitochondrial health, lactate levels(which are healthy for the brain), SGK1 levels, etc. all of which are linked depression.

If someone's mental illness is due to to a physically impaired brain then it might be that no amount of "therapy" or drugs will help. If say it's due to poor mitochondrial health, they aren't going to fix that. Sure therapy and drugs might be useful in the short term to get someone back into a state where they can exercise, have a good diet and sleep. 

Do you think the life would have been less stressful, 1,000 years ago, what about 10,000 or 100,000 years ago?

>Lifestyle factors have been acknowledged to be modifiable targets that can be used to counter the increasing prevalence of depression...  Combining genetic risk and lifestyle category in 197,344 participants, we found that a healthy lifestyle decreased the risk of depression across a population with varied genetic risk. Mendelian randomization confirmed the **causal relationship between lifestyle and depression**. A broad range of brain regions and peripheral biomarkers were related to lifestyle, including the pallidum, the precentral cortex, triglycerides and C-reactive protein. Structural equation modeling on 18,244 participants revealed underlying neurobiological mechanisms involving lifestyle, brain structure, immunometabolic function, genetics and depression. Together, our findings suggest that adherence to a healthy lifestyle could aid in the prevention of depression.

# Cognitive emotional regulation(CER)

Positive attitude and sleep are important factors in how you deal with stress and whether it results in depression or anxiety. 

>Adaptive cognitive emotion regulation (CER) strategies (i.e. **positively-focused thought processes**) can help to prevent psychiatric disturbance when enduring unpleasant and stressful experiences... . Sleep plays an important role in [mental health](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/mental-health "Learn more about mental health from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), and may moderate the effectiveness of adaptive CER strategies by maintaining the [executive functions](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/executive-functions "Learn more about executive functions from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") on which they rely...These findings highlight the importance of adaptive CER strategy use and good sleep quality in promoting resilience to depression and anxiety when experiencing chronic stress.

## Exercise

There are good strong causal studies showing that exercise reduces anxiety and depression.

>Aerobic exercises, including jogging, swimming, cycling, walking, gardening, and dancing, **have been proved to reduce anxiety and depression**.3 These improvements in mood are proposed to be caused by exercise-induced increase in blood circulation to the brain and by an influence on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and, thus, on the physiologic reactivity to stress.3 This physiologic influence is probably mediated by the communication of the HPA axis with several regions of the brain, including the limbic system, which controls motivation and mood; the amygdala, which generates fear in response to stress; and the hippocampus, which plays an important part in memory formation as well as in mood and motivation.

>In conclusion, PA is effective for improving depression and anxiety across a very wide range of populations. All PA modes are effective, and higher intensity is associated with greater benefit.

## Exercise is as if not more effective

In terms of effect size, studies show that exercise is as good if not more effective than therapy or drugs.

>The diet may have a significant effect on preventing and treating depression for the individual. A diet that protects and promotes depression should consist of vegetables, fruits, fibre, fish, whole grains, legumes and less added sugar, and processed foods. In the public health nurse’s preventative and health-promoting work, support and assistance with changing people’s dietary habits may be effective in promoting depression.

>Researchers discovered that frequent citrus consumption is linked to a 22% lower risk of depression, providing compelling evidence that diet profoundly influences mental health.

>Citrus fruits aren’t the only dietary choice that can positively impact your [mental health](https://www.zmescience.com/science/news-science/a-strikingly-high-percentage-of-mental-health-problems-comes-from-childhood-maltreatment/). Other foods have similarly demonstrated mood-enhancing properties:
>- [Leafy greens](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6211514/): Spinach, kale, and Swiss chard are rich in folate, a nutrient strongly associated with lower rates of depression.
>- [Berries](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11139700/): Blueberries, strawberries, and raspberries contain antioxidants and flavonoids linked to improved cognitive function and reduced depression risk. In fact, berries seem to have an even stronger impact than citrus.

# Sleep

Sleep is really important, if you aren't sleeping properly you have have a tenfold higher risk of depression,

>People with insomnia , for example, may have a tenfold higher risk of developing depression From [https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/depression-and-sleep-understanding-the-connection](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/depression-and-sleep-understanding-the-connection)

And it's a bidirectional relationship not that just that depressed people sleep less.

>Why Sleep is Key: Poor Sleep Quality is a Mechanism for the Bidirectional Relationship between Major Depressive Disorder and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Across
[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0887618522000743](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0887618522000743)

# Mechanisms

While we can say with confidence that exercise, diet and sleep have positive causal impacts on mental health, it's not so hard to say anything definitive about the mechanisms.

I suspect that it's likely a combination of mechanisms, here are some that might come into play.

>The mechanisms underlying the antidepressant effects of exercise remain in debate; however, the efficacy of exercise in decreasing symptoms of depression has been well established
[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC474733/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC474733/)


## Brain volume

I say brain volume, but it's probably just a measure of brain health and might be more of an outcome rather than direct mechanism.

So depression is associated with small brain volume.

>This study shows that a more severe and chronic lifetime disease course in MDD is associated with **reduced volume in brain regions** relevant for executive and cognitive functions and emotion regulation in a large sample of patients representing the broad heterogeneity of MDD disease course.
>[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/da.23260](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/da.23260)


Sleep, diet and exercise, are all linked mostly causally to brain volume.

>Conclusion: Our results suggest that lower CV fitness and exaggerated exercise BP and HR responses in middle-aged adults are associated with smaller brain volume nearly 2 decades later. Promotion of midlife CV fitness may be an important step towards ensuring healthy brain aging. 
>[https://n.neurology.org/content/86/14/1313.short?rss=1](https://n.neurology.org/content/86/14/1313.short?rss=1)


>A better diet quality is associated with larger brain tissue volumes. 
>[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29769374/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29769374/)

>We found that longitudinal measures of cortical atrophy were widely correlated with sleep quality.
>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4162301/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4162301/)

> Research shows that short sleep duration is linked to brain volume loss (e.g., grey matter and hippocampus) [[52](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S227458072500113X#bib0052)] 
## Mitochondrial health

Then you could do something similar for all other potential mechanism like mitochondrial health, etc.

>Mitochondrial Deterioration Linked to Major Depression

[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36153290/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36153290/)

Then exercise is extensively linked to mitochondrial health

>Exercise is one of the most effective strategies to maintain a healthy body and mind, with particular beneficial effects of exercise on promoting brain plasticity, increasing cognition and reducing the risk of cognitive decline and dementia in later life. Moreover, the beneficial effects resulting from increased physical activity occur at different levels of cellular organization, mitochondria being preferential target organelles.

## BDNF

Maybe it's related to BDNF levels, some even suspect it's actually how SSRIs work.

>Exercise promotes the expression of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)

## Reduced inflammation

>We have summarised a wide range of research indicating that depression, especially anhedonia, is associated with raised levels of inflammatory cytokines and other markers of inflammation, disrupted dopamine transmission and reward processing and in particular lower propensity to exert both physical and cognitive effort. We propose that this may be an important pathway through which exercise exerts an antidepressant effect. The antidepressant effect of aerobic exercise has been convincingly demonstrated through randomised controlled trials

# APPL1

>These findings not only elucidate a novel role for APPL1 nuclear translocation in mediating the antidepressant effects of acute exercise but also identify AdipoR1 as a potential therapeutic target for developing rapid-acting antidepressant interventions.

## General brain health

It might be since exercise keeps the frontoparietal parts of your brain functioning correctly.

>Physical fitness is associated with neural activity during working memory performance in major depressive disorder.

>Additionally, the dynamic connectivity between the dmPFC and the [inferior frontal gyrus](https://medicalxpress.com/tags/inferior+frontal+gyrus/), as well as the cerebellum, was found to be particularly important in predicting rumination.

>Cardiorespiratory fitness was positively associated with whole-brain modularity, between-network connectivity of the central executive and salience networks, and within-network connectivity of the default mode, central executive, and salience networks. The association of cardiorespiratory fitness and default mode network connectivity was stronger in the presence of moderate-to-severe depression symptoms. Taken together, these observations lend support to prior work that has demonstrated the associations of cardiorespiratory fitness with reduced concurrent and prospective depression risk and symptom severity.

## Other

>Repeated or chronic stressful stimuli induce emotion- and mood-related abnormalities, such as anxiety and depression. Conversely, regular exercise exerts protective effects...

Maybe it's related to Shor Chain Fatty Acids(SCFA)

>This study aims to investigate combining an extensive range of lifestyle factors, including alcohol consumption, diet, physical activity, sleep, smoking, sedentary behavior and social connection, that contribute to depression, and examine the underlying neurobiological mechanisms. Over nine years of follow-up, a multivariate Cox model was utilized on 287,282 participants from UK Biobank to demonstrate the protective roles of seven lifestyle factors and combined lifestyle score on depression. Combining genetic risk and lifestyle category in 197,344 participants, we found that a healthy lifestyle decreased the risk of depression across a population with varied genetic risk. Mendelian randomization confirmed the causal relationship between lifestyle and depression. A broad range of brain regions and peripheral biomarkers were related to lifestyle, including the pallidum, the precentral cortex, triglycerides and C-reactive protein. Structural equation modeling on 18,244 participants revealed underlying neurobiological mechanisms involving lifestyle, brain structure, immunometabolic function, genetics and depression. Together, our findings suggest that adherence to a healthy lifestyle could aid in the prevention of depression.

Or the studies take people off SSRI quickly, so it's not a relapse but withdrawal effect form the drug.

Study 329, Paxil, GSK did a study that showed there were no benefits in adolescents but caused suicidal behaviour, so wasn't suitable for adolescents. But they got a PR firm to ghostwrite the study and lied about it, resulting in the one of the largest fines ever $3bn.

>In short, there exists no rigorous corroboration of the serotonin theory, and a significant body of contradictory evidence  …

>Simple biochemical theories that link low levels of serotonin with depressed mood are no longer tenable. ... 
>This pattern of theory making – moving from the pharmacological actions of drugs with some efficacy in treatment to biochemical notions of causation – has been common in biological psychiatry. In such an undeveloped field this approach, though logically precarious, has been a useful heuristic and, in the case of the dopamine hypothesis of psychosis, has been strikingly upheld by advanced brain imaging techniques (2). However, the serotonin hypothesis of depression has not been clearly substantiated. Indeed, dogged by unreliable clinical biochemical findings and the difficulty of relating changes in serotonin activity to mood state, the serotonin hypothesis eventually achieved “conspiracy theory” status, whose avowed purpose was to enable industry to market selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) to a gullible public

### Dangers

They looked at antidepressant use broken down by race/ethnicity, and where there was an increase in use by say white people suicide rates increased. But say it was fairly steady in hispanic or black populations there wasn't an increase in suicide rates. You'd expect that the marginalised races/ethnicities would have have environmental issues resulting in larger increases in suicide over time than white people.

SSRIs make sleep worse. We know how important sleep is for mental health, so taking a drug that impairs it might be counterproductive.

In animal studies on monkeys, SSRIs have all kinds of negative effects both in behaviour, mental tests and brain health.
