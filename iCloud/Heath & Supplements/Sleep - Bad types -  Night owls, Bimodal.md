#sleep

Being a night owl has a biological component, but modern environment and behaviours(late night light, screens, late meals, alcohol, poor health habits, poor sleep habits, etc.) can push your circadian rhythm later and create "social jetlag".  When exposed to natural sunlight night owls start waking up earlier more in line with early birds suggesting many people who think they are night owls are actually morning birds but behaviours keep them up at night. Night owls have higher mortality rates, cancer risk, heart issues, mental health issues, etc. They find forcing a night owl to wake up early reduces depression symptoms and improves physical and mental performance.

## Health and sleep habits linked to chronotype

>People who have a natural preference for staying up late tend to have poorer health habits, including sleep habits, which in turn is associated with reduced wages, according to new research published in Economics and Human Biology.
[https://www.psypost.org/2023/08/new-study-sheds-light-on-the-connection-between-sleeping-patterns-and-wages-168300](https://www.psypost.org/2023/08/new-study-sheds-light-on-the-connection-between-sleeping-patterns-and-wages-168300)

>We find evening chronotype to have a significant indirect negative effect on wages, which occurs through accumulating less work experience and through poor health outcomes...Unsurprisingly, we find that evening chronotype is associated with the poor sleep outcomes of insomnia and sleeping less than 7 h per night. But we also find the choice of low [physical activity](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/physical-activity "Learn more about physical activity from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") in leisure time, higher alcohol consumption, and poor [eating habits](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/eating-habit "Learn more about eating habits from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") are more common for evening chronotypes than for morning chronotype individuals.

Then people who wake up earlier are fitter and exercise more.

>Participants reporting a “definite evening” chronotype were 54% (95% CI, 49% to 59%) more likely to have an unhealthy lifestyle than participants reporting a “definite morning” chronotype. A total of 1925 diabetes cases were documented over 469 120 person-years of follow-up. Compared with the “definite morning” chronotype, the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for diabetes was 1.21 (CI, 1.09 to 1.35) for the “intermediate” chronotype and 1.72 (CI, 1.50 to 1.98) for the “definite evening” chronotype after adjustment for sociodemographic factors, shift work, and family history of diabetes.

>an evening chronotype were more likely to report unhealthy lifestyle behaviors and had increased diabetes risk compared with those with a morning chronotype. Accounting for BMI, physical activity, diet, and other modifiable lifestyle factors attenuated much but not all of the increased diabetes risk.

>While the prevalence of sleep disorders was increasing, several studies have linked diet and physical activity as a cause of it. Indeed, many people complain about their sleeping problems without considering their lifestyle as a cause. This leads the efforts to focus on these principal factors and find their specific effect.
[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s41606-023-00090-4](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s41606-023-00090-4)

Night owls have much worse sleep quality, so it's not like night owls just have an offset sleep schedule.

>Evening types reported poorer subjective sleep quality, which is in line with prior literature (Kitamura et al. 2010; Martin et al. 2012; Roeser et al. 2012; Rique et al. 2014; Yun et al. 2015). Post-hoc analyses showed that poorer self-rated subjective sleep quality, longer sleep onset latency, shorter sleep duration and higher daytime dysfunction were significant mediators of the relationship between chronotype and depressive symptoms.
[https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07420528.2018.1470531](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07420528.2018.1470531)

There are studies linking the poor mental and physical health issues of lower class is partly mediated by the fact they get worse sleep. But it's a modifiable factor which we can change to improve their sleep. 

>The results of the present research are consistent with the hypothesis that people of lower social class backgrounds have poorer mental and physical health partly because they have poorer quality sleep. Ultimately, the present studies have demonstrated a consistent and robust mediation effect of sleep on the relationship between social class and health. This mediation effect remained significant even when controlling for numerous possible confounding variables. In particular, the present research highlights that sleep quality is the most robust sleep measure and thus, a global approach to improving sleep is likely to be the most beneficial when attempting to reduce the impact that social class has on health outcomes.
The results for our first hypothesis imply that sleep needs to be a greater focus when considering the relationship between social class and health. There is robust evidence that sleep interventions can improve sleep quality (Lin et al., [2018](https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bjop.12645#bjop12645-bib-0045)) as well as mental health (Gee et al., [2018](https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bjop.12645#bjop12645-bib-0028)). Given that people from lower social class backgrounds tend to have more depressive symptoms than people from higher social class backgrounds (Demakakos et al., [2008](https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bjop.12645#bjop12645-bib-0016); Rubin et al., [2016](https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bjop.12645#bjop12645-bib-0068)), and these may be mediated by poor sleep, non-pharmacological sleep interventions could be useful to help improve their sleep and subsequently their mental health.

## Light exposure

Night owls go to sleep earlier similar to early birds when just exposed to natural light, showing that for many it's not your biology forcing you to be on tiktok at 2am. It's actually the tiktok usage that makes you a night owl.

Without light exposure bedtimes are mainly in a 3 hour range. 

>Furthermore, we find that after exposure to only natural light, the internal circadian clock synchronizes to solar time such that the beginning of the internal biological night occurs at sunset and the end of the internal biological night occurs before wake time just after sunrise. In addition, we find that later chronotypes show larger circadian advances when exposed to only natural light, making the timing of their internal clocks in relation to the light-dark cycle more similar to earlier chronotypes.

>The most notable finding was that nocturnal time in bed and estimated sleep time, as measured by actigraphy, markedly increased during the experimental period compared to the periods prior to and following the experiment. These increases were primarily driven by a phase-advance shift of sleep onset.
>Our observations provide further evidence for the long-held belief that the absence of modern living conditions is associated with an earlier sleep phase and prolonged sleep duration.
>https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4067433/


>When the duration of the daily light period was manipulated experimentally, melatonin-onset-related transitions in circadian rhythms appeared to be entrained to the light-to-dark transition, while melatonin-offset-related transitions appeared to be entrained to the dark-to-light transition.
>https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2278827/

>The research showed that when teenagers and young adults experience a sense of failing to control their TikTok use, especially when it gets in the way of other responsibilities, they are significantly more likely to postpone going to bed.

>Light exposure affects the circadian system and consequently can affect sleep quality. Only few studies examined this relationship in children. We evaluated associations between light exposure patterns and sleep metrics in children…  These findings further suggest that children may be able to influence their sleep quality by influencing the light exposure patterns during day and night.

## Night owls linked to worse mental health

>Individuals with a morning preference who go to bed early (aligned) exhibit better mental health compared to morning-types who go to bed late (misaligned). Those with an evening preference who sleep late (aligned) demonstrate poorer mental health.

>This 2-sample mendelian randomization analysis of data from nearly 840 000 adults of European ancestry found an association between earlier sleep timing patterns and lower risk of major depressive disorder.

Having a misaligned circadian rhythm is linked to mental health issues.  And there are studies that show that realigning them can reduce depressive symptoms.

>The available evidence on relationships between 2 internal phase markers (e.g., dim light melatonin onset [DLMO] and peak cortisol concentration) suggests these signals may be temporally misaligned in major depressive disorder with greater misalignment associated with more severe depressive symptoms... The internal misalignment subgroup had later DLMO on average, however presented with a diverse range of individual phase angle abnormalities. Diverse disruptions of circadian alignment occur in youth with mental ill-health. The relative timing of core body temperature and melatonin rhythms may be key circadian features linked to depressive symptoms.
https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/07487304251349408

>We speculate that there are multiple potential causal factors that may contribute to circadian misalignment including genetic variations in clock-controlled genes affecting range of entrainment and period of rhythms, mistimed, or irregular zeitgebers (e.g., feeding, exercise, and light patterns), low exposure to zeitgebers (e.g., low light), and hypo- or hypersensitivity to zeitgebers (e.g., circadian light sensitivity). These diverse factors suggest that effective treatment may require personalization of treatment to the specific circadian dysfunction such as phase delay or advance, short or long period, or misalignment ([Lewy, 2009](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/07487304251349408#bibr38-07487304251349408); [McCarthy et al., 2019](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/07487304251349408#bibr42-07487304251349408)). The current evidence suggests that interventions aimed at realigning circadian rhythms may be effective at reducing depressive symptoms, most commonly via phase advance, and particularly in depressed adolescents or young adults who had circadian rhythm delays at baseline ([Wescott et al., 2024](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/07487304251349408#bibr70-07487304251349408)). In addition, evidence for circadian changes (e.g., phase shift) in response to treatments that do not explicitly target circadian alignment (e.g., ketamine, brexpiprazole) continues to emerge ([Moon et al., 2016](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/07487304251349408#bibr50-07487304251349408); [Duncan et al., 2017](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/07487304251349408#bibr16-07487304251349408); [Krystal et al., 2021](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/07487304251349408#bibr36-07487304251349408)). However, to date, there is only preliminary evidence for changes in internal circadian alignment following mood disorder treatment ([Fang et al., 2021](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/07487304251349408#bibr20-07487304251349408); [Krystal et al., 2021](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/07487304251349408#bibr36-07487304251349408)). Further longitudinal investigation of circadian misalignment in mental ill-health is essential to establish the nature of the potential causal relationships suggested here and disentangle treatment implications.

When you force evening people to wake up early they are less depressed, do better on mental and physical metrics.

>Overall, participants demonstrated a significant advance of ∼2 h in sleep/wake timings as measured by [actigraphy](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/actigraphy) and circadian phase markers (dim light [melatonin](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/melatonin) onset and peak time of the cortisol awakening response), whilst having no [adverse effect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/adverse-effect) on sleep duration. Notably, the phase advance was accompanied by significant improvements to self-reported depression and stress, as well as improved cognitive (reaction time) and physical (grip strength) performance measures during the typical ‘suboptimal’ morning hours.

## It's not true that different people will be awake throughout the night

People often refer to this study but it's really just talking about people being in light sleep as various points in the night, so is kind of misleading. If you actually look at the graphs in the study you'll see that the difference in sleep times isn't anywhere as extreme as the headline suggest.

# Bimodal sleep

> I was particularly surprised by the discovery reported by Yetish et al.[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4763365/#B1) that the members of all three of these equatorial societies did not “regularly awaken for extended periods in the middle of the night.” In short, these individuals did not experience a “bimodal sleep pattern.”
[https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4763365/](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4763365/)

>The traditional groups do not regularly awaken for extended periods in the middle of the night (see [supplementary data](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4720388/#SD1)) despite anecdotal reports[[23]
>Historical evidence suggests that “until the close of the early modern era, Western Europeans experienced two major intervals of sleep bridged by up to an hour or more of quiet wakefulness[[30](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4720388/#R30), [33](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4720388/#R33)].” Our results suggest that the bimodal sleep pattern that may have existed in Western Europe is not today present in traditional equatorial groups, and by extension, was probably not present before humans migrated into such areas. Rather, this pattern may have been a consequence of longer winter nights in higher latitudes. In this view, the “recent” disappearance of bimodal sleep was not a pathological development caused by restricted sleep duration, but rather a return to a pattern still seen today in the groups we studied, enabled by the electric lights and temperature control that restored aspects of natural conditions in the tropical latitudes.
