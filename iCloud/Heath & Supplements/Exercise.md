- Exercise snacks - 1minute of burpees or swats.
- Vigorous activity is good for the brain and body. 
	- Norwegian 4x4 has best evidence, 4 minutes as fast as possible, then 3 minutes slow, then 4 fast. Working window is **~155–170 bpm**.
	- Any other type of interval training is good
	

# Mental performance

>These findings suggest that pre-class acute exercise enhances EF and provides a benefit to cognitive flexibility. Accordingly, our results extend previous knowledge by indicating that the cognitive benefits of acute exercise observed primarily in laboratory settings can be translated to real-world educational contexts.

# Vigorous activity

1 minute of vigorous activity is equivalent to 53-94 minutes of light intensity exercise like walking.

>For non-cancer outcomes, the median LPA equivalent per 1 minute of VPA ranges from 53 (ACM) to 94 minutes (type 2 diabetes), reflecting generally weaker dose-response curves of LPA with all outcomes.
