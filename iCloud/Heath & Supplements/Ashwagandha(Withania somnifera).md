Traditional Indian medicine uses ashwagandha for many things, including sexual dysfunction and infertility. The plant’s roots and berries are used to make teas, extracts, and capsules.

One study looked at 46 infertile males and compared their sperm changes after taking ashwagandha or a placebo. Men who took ashwagandha saw:

- increased sperm concentrations
- enhanced volume of ejaculate
- increased serum testosterone levels
- improved sperm motility
