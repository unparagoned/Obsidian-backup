While there is no one magic bullet to cure insomnia and pills probably do more harm than good in the long run, there are some things you can do that significantly help. The cornerstone to healthy sleep is having a routine where you go to sleep at the same time each day. Other techniques, such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for Insomnia(CBT-I), can be more effective than most prescription medicines.

The following are tips and tricks I’ve picked up over the years from books or other decent sources(I’ve noted where I’m speculating, and it should be obvious where it’s a personal preference). It’s best to have a similar routine every day of the week, including weekends. I’ve framed it in the form of an example day, so the tips and timings may vary depending on you and your circumstances. You don’t need to do everything, but I guarantee that following the routine for a week will help even with the worst cases of insomnia. Of course, discuss everything with your doctor first.

Morning

06:30: I’ve woken up, feel rested, have had enough sleep, so it’s time to get up. (I diverge from the standard advice to use an alarm to wake up at the same time each day). So how much sleep is enough?

- I don’t worry too much about how much sleep I get in the short term; while the amount of sleep you get is very important, it can be counterproductive and create unnecessary stress worrying about it.
- I force myself to stay in bed for at least 4.5 hours before getting up. Even if it didn't feel like I got any sleep I've had some non-sleep deep rest which has many benefits of sleep
- I aim to get at least 7-9+ hours of sleep. I don’t worry too much about sleeping too much(Studies showing correlations between sleeping for 12+ hours and worse health outcomes are probably an example of reverse causation where ill people need to sleep more). So I mainly listen to my body and sleep for as long I need.
- When you sleep, the space between your neurons expands so your body can wash away plaques associated with dementia. Studies also show that people who sleep longer are less likely to get dementia. So some experts believe that sleeping less than the standard 7-8 hours puts you at a higher risk of getting dementia.
- If you are consistently sleeping for only 4 hours or over 12 hours, then maybe see a doctor since that may be due to an underlying condition.
- The actual amount of sleep you need depends on what you did that day. If you worked out and did a lot of manual labour, you might need 11 hours of sleep, on the other hand, if you just spent it in front of Netflix you might only need eight hours of sleep.
- It’s going to be hard/impossible to work out exactly how much sleep you need and time it to be at the end of a sleep cycle, but you have a built-in alarm clock that will wake you up when you’ve had enough sleep.
- If you are still sleeping, then almost by definition, you need more sleep, so you shouldn’t use an alarm to wake up.
- You want to wake up naturally at the end of a sleep cycle; having an alarm wake you up in the middle of a sleep cycle can have various negate effects like making you feel tired and groggy when you wake up.
- Alarms are very stressful on your body; I never use the snooze button since it just puts your body under a high level of stress multiple times. Sure you can use one as a backup or let you know it’s time to get out of bed.
- So I think it’s best to go to sleep at the same time each day(that includes weekends and holidays), then waking up naturally once you’ve had enough sleep.

06:45: Go for a 45min jog outside. This is important for two key reasons, blue-light exposure and exercise.

- Once you’ve woken up, you want to expose yourself to sunlight. Your eyes have different receptors for the blue light that are used to calibrate your circadian rhythm. You ideally want to go outside since you get much more blue light exposure outdoors on an overcast day than indoors with bright lights.
- Exercise is important for general health and sleep.
- Studies show that for sleep, the best time to exercise is in the morning. Exercising at night can negatively impact sleep.

07:30: Have a cool shower

- Temperature is a major factor in your circadian rhythm, after you wake up your temperature will increase and peak during the day, then decrease when it comes time to sleep.
- Paradoxically a cold shower will result in an increase in core temperature and vice vera for a hot shower.
- So you probably don’t want a really hot shower in the morning, since that will result in a colder core temperature and will counteract the warming of your temperature once you wake.
- A coolish shower is probably neutral and a good idea.
- A cold shower will result in an increase in core temperature, which will advance your circadian rhythm if done in the morning, making it easier to go to sleep earlier and wake up earlier the next day. (it has the opposite effect in the evening helping you stay up later).

08:00: I have some vitamin D with breakfast. (I’m not confident that vitamin D helps with sleep, but most people don’t get enough sun exposure and are vitamin D deficient, which has many negative health impacts like making you more vulnerable to COVID).

Afternoon

12:00: Make a mental note to stop consuming any caffeine after mid-day.

- The build-up of adenosine makes you sleepy. Caffeine blocks the cell receptors that adenosine uses hence stops you from getting sleepy.
- Caffeine has a half like of 8 hours, so having it even in the late afternoon can impact sleep. Depending on your DNA, you may consume caffeine later in the day or need to avoid caffeine altogether.

Evening

19:00: Limit exposure to blue light.

- I make sure my (Hue) lights are dimmed and set to a yellow/red hue to limit blue light exposure.
- Try to avoid using computers, tablets or phones. But of course, I just need my Reddit fix, so I also use night mode or a blue light filter like f.lux.
- Use blue light filter glasses if needed.

19:00: Make a mental note to stop drinking alcohol.

- While alcohol has a depressant effect on your brain(that’s not sleep), it negatively impacts REM and deep sleep. It also has a rebound effect when it wears off.
- If you want to drink, the best time is in the morning to make sure it’s entirely out of your system when you go to sleep.

Sleep aids

20:30: Take some ZMA (Zinc Magnesium B6) and 3g glycine. Most supplements have limited evidence of efficacy, and most drugs/medicines probably don’t actually help with “sleep” and shouldn’t be taken long term.

- Melatonin. I think there is some evidence of this helping older adults or if you are jet-lagged. But I wouldn’t use it regularly; it's a powerful hormone that is a key factor in puberty and has effects on your reproductive organs. So kids/teenagers should probably steer clear. In most developed countries it's prescription-only, so I would only consider it after speaking to a doctor.
- Most drugs used to help with sleep, like alcohol, zolpidem (Ambien), zopiclone, etc., are depressants and help make you unconscious, which is kind of the complete opposite state your brain is in when you are sleeping. (There are some sleep stages where your brain is more active than when you are awake.)
- So if you take a drug and are unconscious for 12 hours, you may still find your self sleepy since some of that time would be “poor” quality sleep if it counts as sleep at all. There may also be lingering depressant effects after you wake up.
- While I would never use a drug long term to help with sleep, there may be occasions where I’d discuss short term use with my doctor.
- One of the first classes of sleep aids used are anti-histamines like Promethazine. You can usually get them without needing a prescription.
- Minor tranquillizers, benzos, z-drugs such as zolpidem and zopiclone should probably only be used short term. There are so many downsides and likely negatively impact your quality of sleep.
- Major tranquillizers like quetiapine and olanzapine are typically used to treat conditions like schizophrenia and will knock you out(maybe not in the right way). It is thought that in low doses, they act as anti-histamines making you drowsy. Doctors probably shouldn’t be prescribing these for insomnia. The drug companies behind them have been fined millions for pushing off-label use to treat insomnia (and hundreds of millions more related to the dangers of the side effects).
- I avoid using medicines and only consider them a short-term last resort after discussions with a doctor. (Many doctors use medications as a first-line, long term treatment for insomnia… so I think everyone should do some research before seeing a doctor)

20:30: Make a mental note to stop eating anything heavy.

- A heavy meal close to bed can interfere with sleep.
- Some people find a high carb meal actually helps with sleep.

20:45: Have a nice hot bath and turn down the thermostat.

- One cue to your body that it’s time to sleep is a drop in temperature, both the environment’s and your body’s. So turn down the heating in the evening, open a window, etc.
- Paradoxically a hot bath can help since a hot bath causes vasodilation, which causes a drop in body temperature once you get out.

21:15: Have a nighttime herbal tea(caffeine-free) and do something relaxing like reading. (I’m not sure how strong the evidence is that tea helps)

21:30: Get into bed under a single bamboo flat sheet in a dark room. Set the alarm for 08:00. Turn on sleep tracking.

- Bamboo sheets are smooth, light and breathable. I think they are better than cotton/silk.
- I start with a simple flat sheet to help cool my body. I then use a thicker/heavier blanket if I’m still cold after a few minutes. (Some people sleep better with a heavy blanket).
- You want your room to be pitch black, try and turn off/remove any lights/LEDs from your bedroom.
- Get into bed at the same time each day. (An half an hour range may be better and more flexible)
- Choose a time to go to sleep so that I can wake up naturally without needing an alarm.
- You want to go to sleep at specific times, since some early stages of sleep are based on time and going to sleep late means you just miss them.
- Set the alarm as a backup giving me 10 hours of sleep, which usually is more than enough.
- Sleep tracking apps on your phone/watch can be useful. You shouldn’t get obsessed and look at them in detail every night, but they can help on occasions.
- You might not think you got any sleep, but a sleep tracking app can show you that actually, you got way more sleep than you thought.
- One major cause of sleep issues is sleep apnea. Some apps can monitor snoring, and you can use that to help hear if you stop breathing or having other breathing issues at night.

21:35: Sleep meditation. Typically something from calm or headspace, it’s usually something like:

- Clear your mind and concentrate on breathing.
- Do a body scan, so concentrate on your feet, on an out-breath relax your feet, then move onto your lower legs, etc. Once you get to your head, your whole body should be relaxed. Then just concentrate on breathing in and out till you fall asleep.

Nighttime awakenings

11:58: I wake up. I ask alexa what time it is. (This avoids bright light exposure of looking at my phone or any other bright LCD/led screen). I go back to sleep.

02:00: I wake up. I know I should go back to sleep but can’t. I get up for half an hour and do something relaxing, like listening to a podcast and then try to go back to sleep. (This is speculative advice)

- I don’t think it’s good to have a polyphasic sleep pattern, like sleeping for 4 hours, being awake for 1 hour then sleeping for another 4 hours. But there are occasions when I’m restless in bed and can’t get back to sleep, where it helps.

06:30: I’ve woken up, feel rested, have had enough sleep, so it’s time to get up. REPEAT

Insomnia

One major issue with insomnia is that sometimes you associate your bed with sleeplessness rather than sleep. To help resolve this in the short term, you can use sleep restriction. The idea is to restrict the amount you sleep, so you are soo tired that you actually sleep when you are in bed. The way I do it is to go to sleep at the same time each day, but set my alarm to wake me up after 5 hours. I then slowly increase the time and eventually get rid of the alarm.

If you have insomnia, you should see a doctor. Here are some things to keep in mind/discuss with them.

- Get a blood test; are you low on any minerals or vitamins, etc.?
- Get a sleep study to try and identify any underlying issues?
- Get proper CBT-I/therapy to help.
- Do you have any other disorders like bipolar which are impacting your sleep?
- Discuss the benefits, risks, dangers, addiction potential of any potential sleep medicines.

Happy to entertain any comments or corrections. In the future, this might be better as a kind of wiki where everything is sourced, and people can make improvements.
