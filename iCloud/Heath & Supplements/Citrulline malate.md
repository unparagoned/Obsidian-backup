- 6g 3x a day ~18g Citrulline malate
- Have with an anti-oxidant like vitamin C - the nitric oxide will get recycled

The best dose to take in a 24 hour period is 6-18 grams. 6 grams is the minimal amount needed to notice any effects, and doses taken at 18 grams per day had extremely noticeable effects. The best way to do this is to split doses into 4 different times and one of those times should be pre-workout.

Interestingly, consuming citrulline may increase arginine in the body more than consuming arginine itself ([4Trusted Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27749691)).

This is because of differences in how the body processes and absorbs arginine and citrulline ([2Trusted Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23022123)).

The increase in nitric oxide and blood flow may be one of the processes involved in citrulline's beneficial effects on exercise performance.

Although citrulline isn't an amino acid used directly to build proteins, it has been shown to increase protein synthesis by stimulating an important signaling pathway involved in muscle building ([2Trusted Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23022123), [7Trusted Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24972455)).

The subgroup analysis showed a significant diastolic BP reduction in studies that used doses of ≥6 g/day

Moreover, the highest dose of L-cit (9 g/kg), in the studies included in this meta-analysis, had greatest effect.

L-Citrulline Better For Arginine Than Arginine Itself

Both have their strengths, but the win goes to citrulline malate. The key difference is its ability to increase both muscle pumps and performance, meaning more reps, more effective time in the gym, and better results. Another advantage to using citrulline malate is that you don't have to load with it, whereas L-citrulline is most effective after a week of steady usage. That means you can take it right before your workout and experience immediate performance benefits.
