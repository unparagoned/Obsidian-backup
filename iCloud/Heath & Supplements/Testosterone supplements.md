>Testosterone Boosting Supplements That Actually work
>
Which supplements will work for you depends on your individual context.
>
Provided that you have no deficiencies, sleep well, eat well, and aren’t being regularly exposed to any harmful substances, there’s only 1 thing that might work for you (aside from, well… you know).
>
Adaptogens (Ashwagandha)
>
Ashwagandha primarily increases testosterone through its effects on cortisol. Although there is no evidence of ashwagandha increasing testosterone in young, healthy subjects (lack of studies, not lack of results), its ability to reduce cortisol is universal. In one study, ashwagandha alone [increased testosterone by 14.7](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC6438434/)% in overweight men.
>
Common deficiencies (vitamin D, zinc, magnesium)
>
There is still hope. You don’t need to be like the average American to have a micronutrient deficiency. In fact, if you consider any level below the optimal range for testosterone to be a deficiency, then you might be deficient in more things than you think. By correcting these non-optimal levels, you might be able to increase your testosterone substantially.
>
Vitamin D
>
As shown earlier, a vitamin D level of 86(nmol/l) is considered ideal for testosterone production. Anything above 50(nmol/l) is considered ‘sufficient’ by the [National Institue of Health](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer/). That’s 36(nmol/l) off of the ‘ideal’ level.
>
Zinc
>
[Alcohol reduces the absorption of zinc.](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Zinc-HealthProfessional/) 12% of the US population is considered ‘deficient’ in zinc. Unlike vitamin D, we don’t exactly know what the best level of serum zinc is for testosterone levels. It is possible that this level is beyond what the USDA considers ‘sufficient’. In mildly deficient men, zinc supplementation [increased testosterone by 192%.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8875519/#:~:text=Zinc%20supplementation%20of%20marginally%20zinc,testosterone%20levels%20in%20normal%20men)
>
Fish Oil
>
The RDA for fish oil is surprisingly low, and even by these standards, 68% of U.S. adults do not consume enough omega 3s to meet nutritional requirements. You might be able to get away with lower O3 intakes if O6 is likewise low, as the two compete on a variety of levels in the body. It is unlikely that excess O3 intake increases testosterone, but the [ratio between O3 and O6 in the western diet](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4808858/) is so poor that virtually anyone will benefit from supplementation. Supplementation with DHA, an omega 3 fatty acid, [increased serum testosterone levels in obese men by 31%](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33221700/).
>
Sleep
>
The 15% increase in testosterone shown in the infographic above is an extrapolated inversion of the [effects of acute sleep deprivation on testosterone.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4445839/) Luckily, the study referenced here was performed on young, healthy men. It is likely that the true effect of going from 5 hours of sleep to 9 hours on testosterone is more profound than this extrapolation suggests. Americans sleep on average 6.8 hours, which is markedly lower than the 9 hours presented in this study.
>
Conclusion
>
The only testosterone-boosting supplements that may work for healthy, young men are adaptogens. However, young≠healthy, and it can be argued that most young men in the first world are not completely void of deficiencies if one considers a deficiency to be a blood level that does not maximize testosterone production. For this portion of the population, vitamin D, zinc, and fish oil are the most cost-effective and proven supplements to increase testosterone.
