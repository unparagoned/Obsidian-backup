 I don't think we know anything for sure, but your best bet for preventing and treating dementia is the shingles vaccine, then the usual exercise, diet and sleep. 

Pretty much all the sleeping pills are linked to dementia, from anti-histamines you can pick off the shelf to Z-drugs your doctor prescribes and anti-psychotics(pharma companies have paid billions in fines relating to pushing this but doctors still irresponsibly prescribe them for insomnia). The only exception are DORA drugs which might actually help clear amyloid(but I've herd from an insider to be very suspicious of anything relating to DORA drugs and the data they have seen doesn't match the published data.)


Some mechanisms for the sleep drug and dementia here

# Exercise

Exercise was more effective than everything else tested.

>For the AD portrait, the top three scoring treatments for reversing AD expression with little effect on exacerbating AD expression were for exercise.

Exercise is associated with  lower dementia risk.


>These data suggest that aerobic exercise is associated with a reduced risk of cognitive impairment and dementia; it may slow dementing illness.

>High CRF[cardiorespiratory fitness] is associated with better cognitive performance at baseline, and lower dementia risk long-term. High CRF could mitigate the impact of genetic predisposition on the development of dementia by 35%.

>Associations of high cardiovascular fitness with larger age-related regional gray matter volume and better fluid cognitive performance suggest the importance of maintaining or improving CRF in mitigating age-related brain volume loss and cognitive decline across the adult lifespan.

Then we have studies showing the causal impact of exercise training on the brain.

Exercise improves brain vascularity, which is also linked to dementia

>Pulse wave encephalopathy (PWE) is hypothesised to initiate many forms of dementia, motivating its identification and risk assessment. nOur preliminary analyses in a cohort of 20 subjects indicate that this measurement agrees with clinical observations relating blood pulsatility with age, heart rate, and sex, making it a suitable candidate to study the risk of PWE. We identified transmission differences between vascular regions perfused by the basilar and internal carotid arteries attributed to the identified dependence on cerebral blood flow, and some participants presented differences between the internal carotid perfused regions that were not related to flow or pulsatility burden, suggesting underlying mechanical differences

>A study led by scientists at Rutgers University-New Brunswick has shown that specialized cells involved in how the body responds to insulin are activated in the brain after exercise, suggesting that physical activity may directly improve brain function.

# Diet

Diet is associated with  lower levels of dementia.

>MIND diet, a hybrid of the Mediterranean diet and the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet, is associated with a slower cognitive decline and lower risk of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) dementia in older adults. 
>[https://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-alzheimers-disease/jad210107](https://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-alzheimers-disease/jad210107)

>The MIND and Mediterranean diets are associated with less postmortem AD pathology, primarily beta-amyloid load. Among dietary components, green leafy vegetables inversely correlate with AD pathology.
[https://n.neurology.org/content/early/2023/03/08/WNL.0000000000207176](https://n.neurology.org/content/early/2023/03/08/WNL.0000000000207176)

>Sticking to a Mediterranean-style diet, known as the MIND diet (Mediterranean–Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay) may reduce dementia risk, according to international research. The diet emphasises natural plant-based foods, limits the intake of animal foods and foods high in saturated fat, and uniquely encourages people to eat berries and green leafy vegetables rich in vitamins and antioxidants. The study, which looked at 200,000 people, found that those who stuck to the diet the best had a 17% lower risk of dementia compared with people with the worst adherence to the diet.

>The results show that the western diet pattern is a risk factor for developing AD. In contrast, the Mediterranean diet, ketogenic diet, and supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids and probiotics are protective factors.

>"This crucial result was discovered because we investigated Alzheimer's disease pathology as early as midlife—in the 40s and 50s—when the disease pathology is at its earliest stages, and potential modifications like weight loss and reducing visceral fat are more effective as a means of preventing or delaying the onset of the disease,"

# Sleep

Sleep is associated with increased dementia risk, probably through multiple mechanisms. When you sleep your clear out amyloid and other metabolites from the brain. When you don't sleep you release less PTN, which is lined to dementia. 


>Persistent short sleep duration at age 50, 60, and 70 compared to persistent normal sleep duration was also associated with a 30% increased dementia risk independently of sociodemographic, behavioural, cardiometabolic, and mental health factors.  
>[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-22354-2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-22354-2)

This seems to line up with the fact people who have a better diet and exercise more who have a massively lower rate of dementia.

>An international team of researchers found among older Tsimane and Moseten people, only about 1% suffer from dementia. In contrast, 11% of people age 65 and older living in the United States have dementia, according to the Alzheimer’s Association.
>“Something about the pre-industrial subsistence lifestyle appears to protect older Tsimane and Moseten from dementia,” said Margaret Gatz, the lead study author and professor of psychology, gerontology and preventive medicine at the Center for Economic and Social Research at the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences.

>weaker and more fragmented circadian RARs and later peak activity time were prospectively associated with elevated dementia risk

And there are animal studies that suggest mechanisms for this.

>Not only does a lack of sleep make you feel awful, research has shown it impairs the brain. What’s more, sleep loss over long periods can even increase risk for Alzheimer’s and other neurological diseases. Researchers want to understand how sleep deprivation causes this harm. In a new study in ACS’ _Journal of Proteome Research_, a team working with mice has identified a protective protein whose level declines with sleep deprivation, leading to neuronal death.

>the decreased secretion of Ptn induced by insomnia leads to reduced binding to Ptprz1 on the postsynaptic membrane with the activation of the MAPK pathway via Fos and Nr4a1, further leading to the apoptosis of neurons. In addition, Ptn is genetically _trans_-regulated in the mouse hippocampus and implicated in neurodegenerative diseases in human genome-wide association studies. Our study provides a novel biomarker for insomnia-induced cognitive impairment and a new strategy for seeking neurological biomarkers by the integration of proteomics and systems genetics.

# Sarcastic

I'm sick of all these studies trying to link diet, exercise and sleep to beneficial outcomes when it comes to dementia.

There are hundreds if not thousands of these studies, all with issues.

The big ones are just correlation studies, and we all know correlation isn't causation. Like this study links good health outcomes to exercise, but people who exercise more might eat better, so we can't make any conclusion there.

Other studies show a correlation with diet, but people who eat better, also exercise more, so we can't make any conclusion there.

They have hypothesis and have shown them to be true in RCT in mice, but mice are different to humans, so we can't make any conclusions there.

Another study only studied a thousand people, sample size is way too small to make any conclusions there.

There are literally hundreds, if not thousands of studies like this, all with their own issues and not worth listening to.

The only thing that will change my mind is a good study like a RCT of a million people from birth in a controlled lab until old age.

Look at all the suckers thinking that exercise, sleep and diet might help with dementia. Idiots for not seeing these are just correlation studies and we all know correlation means no causation.

# Notes

Exercise is important, need blood flow to keep blood vesicles open.

Might be related to blood vessels and BBB
