If people mean free will in terms of natural powers, but the media and others talk about how free will in terms of supernatural powers doesn't exist, then lay people may start to deny their natural powers.

Libet and other studies, are designed so there is no preplanning, they command people not to act with conscious planning.

Free will is about important decisions, your consciously think about and deliberate. e.g. is about what career to pursue, not pressing a button.

At the end lots of studies or details about where people might give up some of their free will unconsciously or consciously. e.g. milgrim with strong shocks.

We don't always know the factors that control us.

Hypethetical sitions are unlikely/impossible
