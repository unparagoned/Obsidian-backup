#preservatives

>Experimental studies suggested potential adverse effects of preservative food additives, but epidemiological data are lacking.
Thirteen (12 after multiple test correction) widely used individual preservatives are associated with higher diabetes incidence (n=1131cases): potassium sorbate, potassium metabisulfite, sodium nitrite, acetic, citric and phosphoric acids, sodium acetates, calcium propionate, sodium ascorbate, alpha-tocopherol, sodium erythorbate, and rosemary extracts. These findings call for their safety re-evaluation and support recommendations to favour fresh and minimally processed foods without superfluous additives.
