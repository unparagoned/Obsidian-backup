The consumption of sugars, mainly as sucrose and glucose-fructose syrups, has dramatically increased worldwide and growing concerns about their adverse effects on health and metabolic diseases, such as metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular diseases, and type 2 diabetes (T2D), have motivated people to reduce the consumption of free sugars.

Saccharin is excreted through urine and is not metabolized in the body, although it can cross the placenta and can be transferred through breast milk. Its consumption is not recommended for pregnant or breastfeeding women.

In addition, mice treated with aspartame for 11 wk developed glucose intolerance, although analyses of the microbiota did not show significant differences between the groups ([15](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6363527/#bib15)).

From <[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6363527/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6363527/)>

The presence of saccharin did not alter the total numbers of anaerobic microbes but resulted in the elimination of a specific anaerobic group of microbes from the cecal contents

Polyols are noncariogenic, do not induce salivation, and do not interfere with insulin concentrations or increase the blood glucose response;

These findings suggest that NAS consumption, and especially saccharin at a maximum dose, might have a deleterious effect on glucose tolerance through changes to the intestinal microbiota.

Nevertheless, the simple message from this study is that dietary sugar alternatives meant to stave off the risk of obesity and diabetes might increase the risk of those diseases.

From <[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6363527/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6363527/)>

However, some long-term prospective studies raise the concern that the consumption of artificial sweeteners might actually contribute to the development of metabolic derangements that lead to obesity, T2D, and cardiovascular disease ([101](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6363527/#bib101)). In addition, there are gaps in the evidence related to the effects of NNSs on appetite, short-term intake, and risk of cancer and diabetes ([2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6363527/#bib2)). The effects of sweeteners on gut microbiota have not been completely elucidated.

Magnuson, Bernadene A

This author always puts down no conflict of interest, but first google result says they are on the board of the "Stevia Institute". Also the conclusions don't seem to match up to the narrative in their reviews. e.g. Some studies showed impaired gycemic response and others did not, but they concluded since there wasn't overwhelming evidence then there is no issue. When I would have expected it to be more balanced like the evidence isn't clear, not that the evidence is clear that it's safe.

Sweeteners release more insulin which could be related to increase heart issues.

One of the most common sugar substitutes, aspartame, has been found to spike insulin levels in mice, and in turn helps build up fatty plaque in their arteries, which increases their risk of heart attacks and stroke, say Chinese, Swedish and US researchers.

From <[https://www.scimex.org/newsfeed/common-artificial-sweetener-can-damage-the-hearts-of-mice](https://www.scimex.org/newsfeed/common-artificial-sweetener-can-damage-the-hearts-of-mice)>

Consumption of artificial sweeteners (ASWs) in various foods and beverages has been linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). However, molecular mechanisms underlying ASW-associated CVD remain unknown. Here, we show that consumption of 0.15% aspartame (APM) markedly increased insulin secretion in mice and monkeys.

People who consume some artificial sweeteners are less likely to respond to certain cancer therapies, potentially because of the impact on their gut microbiome

# Arguing with pro sweetener

\>Here is Dr Idz video about this exact study! I asked him directly about it and he sent me this video where he already addressed it soon after its release. Let me know your thoughts! This study arguably has many flaws as I initially thought. In the comments he calls it a well conducted study but states that it does not at all change the current consensus.
 
Thanks, but it's not clear they read the full thing or even the meta studies they quoted in detail.
 
The main issue is they ignored the main and best bit of the study, around the mice. How does home testing, nocebo(placebo), time of day, etc. apply to the fact the mice with faecal transplants had similar changes in their glycaemic response. Or the fact they were able to identify the bacteria responsible for those changes?
 
I looked up one of the meta studies Néma D McGlynn 2022, the tic toker quoted, and if you look at the details it lines up exactly with this study. So it actually supports this cell study rather than suggest that it's wrong.
 
Let's break it down.
 
* Them taking the test at home:  
* They had continuous glucose monitors, not particularly hard test to drink some sugary water.  
* There were other sweeteners and the control didn't show similar impairment to glucose response.  
* They transplanted the gut microbiome to mice. The mice weren't doing the glucose response test themselves.  
* Why doesn't the insulin rise. He suggests this is an issue with home testing.  
* They were testing resting levels of insulin, so you wouldn't necessarily expect them to rise.  
* This was a short period tests as they pointed out, you might not expect these kind of changes over a short period.  
* The blood tests were obviously in a clinic not at home.  
* So the tic tocker seems to have been in a rush reading through it and not really understood that the insulin tests were not done as part of the home glucose tests.  
* Not factoring stuff like time of day, nocebo, etc.  
* It's a RCT, so the assignment of the sweetener was randomly assigned, which would average out these impacts and not be something you really need to address. If the sample size was really small and there was lots of variance then maybe, but that wasn't the case.  
* Secondly, how do any of these apply to the controlled experiments on mice. Do you seriously think these mice had some kind of placebo effect impacting the results? The mice didn't even consume the sweaters.
 
&#x200B;
 
In terms of the meta studies. I don't think they contradict this cell study
 
* Nema D Glynn 2022 [[https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2790045](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2790045)](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2790045]\(https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2790045\))  
* If you select the Sweis cell study said was fine in respect to glycaemic response.  
* There was only one study in the meta that looked at saccharin and sucralose and both had incomplete outcome data. [If you look at the analysis](https://cdn.jamanetwork.com/ama/content_public/journal/jamanetworkopen/938870/zoi220092supp1_prod_1646681675.9529.pdf?Expires=1673256193&Signature=nmMZyVQtD-2mb1sh671r5FtP8-cgVKkK-10ThYuczR3f~kwMyaP-7LOEICqPMNXVYBao3ufRwm1QDvQE~QVfdpk~Yy0a57H8Vs8BoLW0xD7deANdfdJSDPvsdz3~Pn09yUYGgeIMdjnkwu7bhhSMOPpzeRJAZ7WFb9SsLKmHhaVZQT46TLHkIdzAxaZy1NZ6--5JTWfJMiR~UvNqleTxZoppGoHsH4WpctAf6J2WQVstMl0RpGAWKwaP8VgEJb~fYiNptXSpfazpK8C7gfOB~~JTHMJo9vXt20l7Q5DLtoq31FHx84pounqgmNJmmkcifWDAAVpS1Wu06pvuuIo15w__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA), you'll see they are often lumping stuff together.  
* There is some breakdown, which shows that saccharin did result in worse GbA1c a levels also had worse results in post-prandial glucose tests.
 
So this Nema meta which your tic tocker brings up as suggesting that actually this cell study as wrong, doesn't do anything of the kind. This Nema meta just supports the results of this study, in that aspartame doesn't have any negative impact on glycaemic response. If you dig into the details the Nema meta actually does suggest that saccharin and sucralose does have negative impacts on the glycaemic response.
 
I'm not going to look at every meta review in detail, but I expect similar results. The vast majority of studies are on aspartame hence I don't expect general metas to really get at saccharin and sucralose. Sweeteners are completely different chemicals which work in different kinds of ways, you just can't lump them all together. But if there is a specific meta which does say that saccharin and sucralose don't have a negative impact on glycaemic response let me know.
  The point around period is fair criticism for this cell study. But that meta your doctor referred to did cover a longer period and did suggest that it's a long term problem.
