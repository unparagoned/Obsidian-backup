# Dengue treatment abandoned

>Two years ago, the pharmaceutical company Johnson & Johnson (J&J) announced some rare good news about dengue, a crippling viral infection that threatens half of the world’s population. A clinical trial had shown an antiviral compound could prevent the disease in people deliberately exposed to the virus. “The development of a dengue antiviral is critically important to global health,” [the company said in a press release at the time](https://www.jnj.com/media-center/press-releases/janssen-announces-promising-antiviral-activity-against-dengue-in-a-phase-2a-human-challenge-model)
...
 But that trial [was halted in October 2024](https://www.jnj.com/media-center/press-releases/johnson-johnson-to-discontinue-phase-2-field-study-evaluating-investigational-antiviral-for-the-prevention-of-dengue), when J&J decided to pull out of the infectious diseases market
