 I don't think we know anything for sure, but your best bet for preventing and treating dementia is diet, exercise and sleep.

# Exercise

Exercise was more effective than all medicines tested.

>For the AD portrait, the top three scoring treatments for reversing AD expression with little effect on exacerbating AD expression were for exercise.

Exercise is associated with  lower dementia risk.


>These data suggest that aerobic exercise is associated with a reduced risk of cognitive impairment and dementia; it may slow dementing illness.

>High CRF[cardiorespiratory fitness] is associated with better cognitive performance at baseline, and lower dementia risk long-term. High CRF could mitigate the impact of genetic predisposition on the development of dementia by 35%.

>Associations of high cardiovascular fitness with larger age-related regional gray matter volume and better fluid cognitive performance suggest the importance of maintaining or improving CRF in mitigating age-related brain volume loss and cognitive decline across the adult lifespan.

Then we have studies showing the causal impact of exercise training on the brain.

>Increased within- and between-network connectivity following ET[exercise training] may subserve improvements in memory performance in older individuals with intact cognition and with MCI due to Alzheimer’s disease.

Exercise improves brain vascularity, which is also linked to dementia

>Pulse wave encephalopathy (PWE) is hypothesised to initiate many forms of dementia, motivating its identification and risk assessment. nOur preliminary analyses in a cohort of 20 subjects indicate that this measurement agrees with clinical observations relating blood pulsatility with age, heart rate, and sex, making it a suitable candidate to study the risk of PWE. We identified transmission differences between vascular regions perfused by the basilar and internal carotid arteries attributed to the identified dependence on cerebral blood flow, and some participants presented differences between the internal carotid perfused regions that were not related to flow or pulsatility burden, suggesting underlying mechanical differences

>A study led by scientists at Rutgers University-New Brunswick has shown that specialized cells involved in how the body responds to insulin are activated in the brain after exercise, suggesting that physical activity may directly improve brain function.
Our work suggests that therapies that target brain insulin action may be able to ward off dementia

# Diet

Diet is associated with  lower levels of dementia.

>MIND diet, a hybrid of the Mediterranean diet and the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet, is associated with a slower cognitive decline and lower risk of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) dementia in older adults. 
>[https://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-alzheimers-disease/jad210107](https://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-alzheimers-disease/jad210107)

>The MIND and Mediterranean diets are associated with less postmortem AD pathology, primarily beta-amyloid load. Among dietary components, green leafy vegetables inversely correlate with AD pathology.
[https://n.neurology.org/content/early/2023/03/08/WNL.0000000000207176](https://n.neurology.org/content/early/2023/03/08/WNL.0000000000207176)

>Sticking to a Mediterranean-style diet, known as the MIND diet (Mediterranean–Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay) may reduce dementia risk, according to international research. The diet emphasises natural plant-based foods, limits the intake of animal foods and foods high in saturated fat, and uniquely encourages people to eat berries and green leafy vegetables rich in vitamins and antioxidants. The study, which looked at 200,000 people, found that those who stuck to the diet the best had a 17% lower risk of dementia compared with people with the worst adherence to the diet.

>The results show that the western diet pattern is a risk factor for developing AD. In contrast, the Mediterranean diet, ketogenic diet, and supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids and probiotics are protective factors.

>Compared with no consumption, daily nut consumption (> 0 to 3 or more handfuls) was significantly associated with a 12% lower risk of all-cause dementia

>"This crucial result was discovered because we investigated Alzheimer's disease pathology as early as midlife—in the 40s and 50s—when the disease pathology is at its earliest stages, and potential modifications like weight loss and reducing visceral fat are more effective as a means of preventing or delaying the onset of the disease,"

# Sleep

Sleep is associated with increased dementia risk

>Persistent short sleep duration at age 50, 60, and 70 compared to persistent normal sleep duration was also associated with a 30% increased dementia risk independently of sociodemographic, behavioural, cardiometabolic, and mental health factors.  
>[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-22354-2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-22354-2)

This seems to line up with the fact people who have a better diet and exercise more who have a massively lower rate of dementia.

>An international team of researchers found among older Tsimane and Moseten people, only about 1% suffer from dementia. In contrast, 11% of people age 65 and older living in the United States have dementia, according to the Alzheimer’s Association.
>“Something about the pre-industrial subsistence lifestyle appears to protect older Tsimane and Moseten from dementia,” said Margaret Gatz, the lead study author and professor of psychology, gerontology and preventive medicine at the Center for Economic and Social Research at the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences.

# Sarcastic

I'm sick of all these studies trying to link diet, exercise and sleep to beneficial outcomes when it comes to dementia.

There are hundreds if not thousands of these studies, all with issues.

The big ones are just correlation studies, and we all know correlation isn't causation. Like this study links good health outcomes to exercise, but people who exercise more might eat better, so we can't make any conclusion there.

Other studies show a correlation with diet, but people who eat better, also exercise more, so we can't make any conclusion there.

They have hypothesis and have shown them to be true in RCT in mice, but mice are different to humans, so we can't make any conclusions there.

Another study only studied a thousand people, sample size is way too small to make any conclusions there.

There are literally hundreds, if not thousands of studies like this, all with their own issues and not worth listening to.

The only thing that will change my mind is a good study like a RCT of a million people from birth in a controlled lab until old age.

Look at all the suckers thinking that exercise, sleep and diet might help with dementia. Idiots for not seeing these are just correlation studies and we all know correlation means no causation.
