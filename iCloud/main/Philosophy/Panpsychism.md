Let's say you have a simulation of physics, the physics of a human brain. If you are saying that simulation of a brain isn't conscious. 

You might have to bite the bullet in that the brain doesn't obey the laws of physics, hence a simulation of physics can't simulate the brain.

Or if you are saying the simulation is the same as the real brain, but the just doesn't have the consciousness experience. Then the panpsychism consciousness is an epiphenomena, and they don't exist.
