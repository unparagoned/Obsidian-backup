You could use an optical illusion so show Mary other colours but induce the experience of seeing red, so when she actually observes red outside the room it's nothing new.

Or if she really knows everything about red, then we would induce the neural activity the causes the experience of red, so she experiences the neural activity of red inside the room, so when she observes red outside the room it's nothing new.


>Jackson himself went on to reject epiphenomenalism and mind–body dualism altogether. He argues that, because when Mary first sees red, she says "Wow!", it must be Mary's qualia that causes her to say "Wow!". This contradicts epiphenomenalism because it involves a conscious state causing an overt speech behavior. Since the Mary's room thought experiment seems to create this contradiction, there must be something wrong with it. Jackson now believes that the physicalist approach (from a perspective of [indirect realism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_and_indirect_realism "Direct and indirect realism")) provides the better explanation. In contrast to epiphenomenalism, Jackson says that the experience of red is entirely contained in the brain, and the experience immediately causes further changes in the brain (e.g. creating memories). This is more [consilient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consilience "Consilience") with neuroscience's understanding of [color vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_vision "Color vision"). Jackson suggests that Mary is simply discovering a new way for her brain to represent qualities that exist in the world.
