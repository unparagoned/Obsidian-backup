In “Artefacts,” Nick Kyme returns to the Salamanders Legion to explore the enduring power of the relics forged by their Primarch, Vulkan. Taking place after the devastating Dropsite Massacre on Isstvan V, the story follows a small band of surviving Salamanders who risk everything to protect or recover these precious heirlooms. Each artifact, imbued with Vulkan’s craftsmanship and legacy, holds deep symbolic meaning for the Legion—reminders of their Primarch’s ideals of resilience, brotherhood, and the sanctity of life.  
As the Salamanders navigate a war-torn galaxy teetering on the brink of Chaos, “Artefacts” highlights their determination to uphold Vulkan’s example and keep hope alive. The story focuses on themes of loyalty, the power of belief, and the bonds that unite battle-brothers in the face of overwhelming darkness. Ultimately, the relics become more than just physical objects; they are touchstones of the Legion’s identity and a source of strength as the Horus Heresy rages on.
