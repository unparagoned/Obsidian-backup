9/10
 
Good book.
 
Bascially about Vulkan being captured. He's imortal so linked to those immortal people.  
That imortal guy was on a mission to get some lightning thing from the emperor, it's like a weapon
 
End he teleported then died, bit confusing, in terms of how or why he died, or what the whole point was.
