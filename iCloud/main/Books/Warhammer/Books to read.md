Commonwealth Saga fan looking for recommendations  
I'm a huge fan of The Commonwealth Saga by Peter F. Hamilton. Does anyone have any suggestions of scifi in this vein?
 
==Hyperion and Endymion by Simmons.==  
==Revelation Space by Reynolds.==  
==And while considerably darker at points, Hamilton also did the Night's Dawn Trilogy.==
