Zahariel El'Zurias, a boy native to Caliban, is inducted into the Order, an organisation of knights dedicated to defending the people of Caliban from its many predatory beasts. His induction takes the form of mock interrogation where he is questioned by three of the Order's leaders: Lion El'Jonson, and Luther
 
They hunt the great beasts to extinction
   

There he encounters the Watchers in the Dark, who reveal that the same taint is within Zahariel and is responsible for the Great Beasts' evil, debating whether or not to kill him until he swears to oppose the malign force as they do. They send him on his way, warning him to stay out of the area is it corrupts those within it. Ambushed by the Beast of Endriago, Zahariel is overpowered and near death until his desperation unlocks his latent psyker powers, allowing him to see through the beast's skin and place his pistol directly against its heart. He pulls the trigger, slaying the beast, and takes its head back to Aldurukh as a trophy
   

they discover the Knights of Lupus have been capturing Great Beasts and keeping them in cages.
   

Radical changes occur on Caliban in the times that follow as the Imperium colonises the planet.
 
Plot to kill the emperor, Zahariel stops them and is thanked by the emperor.
 
A Saroshi delegation arrives aboard the Invincible Reason and Zahariel and Luther examine the dilapidated shuttle they arrived in. Luther notices something worrying about the shuttle but dismisses Zahariel's questions, sending him back to his squad
   

Luther and Zahariel manage to eject the shuttle into space, but in the aftermath Luther admits that he noticed the bomb beforehand and initially decided to do nothing as if the Saroshi succeeded in killing the Lion he would get command of the Dark Angels and no longer be forced to live in the Lion's shadow. The Dark Angels launch an attack on Sarosh, targeting a build-up of Warp energy where the Saroshi are attempting to manifest their God, a Chaos Daemon, into the material realm. They succeed in killing the daemon using a psyker bomb crafted by Librarian Israfael, and Sarosh is forcibly taken over. The Lion, however, then sends a large portion of his Legion back to Caliban, ostensibly to speed up the recruitment process of new Space Marines. Notably, Zahariel and Luther are among those banished.
