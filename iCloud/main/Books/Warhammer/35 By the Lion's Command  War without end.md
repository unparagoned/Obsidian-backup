Corswain, get's ship near an independent planet's orbital defences. Then convinces planet to align and help them.
 
Following the splitting of the **Dark Angels** fleet in the aftermath of **Perditus**, **Seneschal** **Corswain** continues to hunt down the **Death Guard** forces under the command of the infamous **Typhon**. Now, a tense standoff erupts in the heavens over the supposedly independent world of **Terra Nullius**, and Corswain must either bend the local population to his own cause or make an example of them to other worlds that might secede from the **Imperium**. In **this war**, there can be no innocent bystanders.
