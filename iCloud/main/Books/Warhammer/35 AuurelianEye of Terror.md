After the destruction of **Monarchia** and the **Emperor**'s reprimanding of the **Word Bearers** Legion, the primarch **Lorgar** spent many long years searching the stars for the universal truths of the cosmos — when he finally came to gaze deep into the **Eye of Terror**, with grim inevitability he found that the Eye stared back. Now, guided by the daemon Ingethel, he undertakes a spiritual journey into the heart of Chaos itself and sees that the entire destiny of mankind and the Imperium could rest upon just a few nexus events. As the Great Crusade burns itself out in treachery and deceit, Lorgar weighs the cost of his ambitions, and sets his course for eternal damnation.
