Read "Affective Neuroscience" (or Archeology of the Mind) by Jaak Panksepp for a better understanding of where emotions come from (primary affect).  
Read "Mindsight" by Daniel Siegel for a view on higher level emotional processing. You can "sample" his ideas by watching some of his interviews on Mindsight.  
Read "Passage Meditation" by Eknath Easwaran for a simple and accessible program of meditation. Meditation, in its various forms, improves emotional control.
   

He then wrote a space opera novel, named _The Night's Dawn Trilogy_. He has also published the _Commonwealth Saga_ with the _Void Trilogy_ and _The Chronicle of the Fallers_ in the same universe.

These sci fi awards are supposed to be good
   

Most SF shorts are "idea" stories, not built on character or plot, but on some cool or unexpected twist. I'm not saying these are the best. They are just the ones that have stuck with me--some for many decades. I tried to only list those I actually remember, rather than looking up a list.  
The Proud Robot, Mimzy Were the Borogroves - Kuttner. Many other great ones. 1940s genius.  
He Built a Crooked House, The Menace From Earth, The Green Hills of Earth - Heinlein. (He has a bunch of great novellas that might belong in this list: Gulf, Elsewhen, etc. And yes, Im one of those Heinlein nuts)  
The Sand Kings - G.R.R. Martin (displaying his penchant for dark stories. I had to look up the author of this one; stunned to discover it was Martin almost forty-five years ago)  
Rescue Party, The Nine Billion Names of God - Clarke  
The Loom of Thessaly - Brin (he has a bunch of great ones about the Fermi paradox))  
Unaccompanied Sonata - Card. I think Ender's Game is brilliant, but shorts are not Card's forte.  
I also love William Gibson, but find his shorts lacking. Same with Stross.

_The Last Question_, Asimov. Hell of a sting in its tail, classic short.  
_The Nine Billion Names of God_ is one of my favourite Clarke shorts. There's a really good adaptation that was published a while ago.

Flowers for Algernon, as I get older I've observed the cognitive decline of my older friends and family, and I can't help but worry if that is the fate that awaits me as well. This story uses sci-fi trappings to tell a story that all of us will face one day, and if it doesn't make you sad and scared you didn't understand it.

OMG, so many SF short stories changed my life, either by challenging some belief, or inspiring me to think about how things really work.  
Hard to recall titles and authors as some were read 40 years ago, but so many I still think about the lessons today.  
I really should re-read my sci-fi anthologies and find those seminal works and make a list.  
My favorite sub-genres of sci-fi are:  
- origin of self-awareness and consciousness  
- social psychology examinations  
- demystification or destruction of false religious beliefs  
- progress social issues

[They’re Made Out of Meat](http://www.terrybisson.com/theyre-made-out-of-meat-2/) by Terry Bisson is a classic.  
Ted Chiang has some real heavy hitters.
