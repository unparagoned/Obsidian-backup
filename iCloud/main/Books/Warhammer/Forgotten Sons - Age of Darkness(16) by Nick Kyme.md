Set during the tumultuous early years of the Horus Heresy, “Forgotten Sons” follows a small delegation of Loyalist Astartes—one from the Salamanders Legion and one from the Ultramarines—dispatched to the distant world of Bastion. Their mission is to secure Bastion’s loyalty to the Emperor amid the growing crisis. However, they soon discover that Traitor forces (specifically Word Bearers) are working behind the scenes to turn the planet to Horus’s cause.  
The story explores the tension between the two Loyalist Legions, whose different philosophies and approaches to war sometimes clash. The Salamanders emphasize compassion and protecting civilians, while the Ultramarines adhere more strictly to discipline and doctrinal efficiency. As they navigate Bastion’s political intrigue and face the Word Bearers’ insidious influence, the Loyalists must learn to unite, bridging their differences to counter the traitor threat. Ultimately, “Forgotten Sons” highlights the fragility of alliances in a galaxy torn apart by betrayal and underscores the resolve of those who remain steadfast in their duty to the Imperium.
