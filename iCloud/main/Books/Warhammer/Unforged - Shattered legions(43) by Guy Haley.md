Set in the wake of the Dropsite Massacre on Isstvan V, “Unforged” follows a small group of survivors from the so-called Shattered Legions—primarily Iron Hands, but also Salamanders and Raven Guard. The story focuses on the Iron Hands’ struggle to reconcile their near-annihilation with their unyielding desire for vengeance against the traitor Legions. As they operate behind enemy lines, the Astartes wrestle with loss, anger, and their own rigid doctrines, forging a new sense of purpose out of the chaos. Through clandestine raids and tense confrontations, “Unforged” underscores the resilience of the Shattered Legions and the enduring will of those who refuse to surrender, even in the face of betrayal and near-destruction.
