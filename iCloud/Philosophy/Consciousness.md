#consciousness

Chalmers defines the hard problem as being unexplainable my materialism.

>The easy problems of consciousness are those that seem directly susceptible to the standard methods of cognitive science, whereby a phenomenon is explained in terms of computational or neural mechanisms. The hard problems are those that seem to resist those methods.

## Mary's room
#marysroom #physicalism #frankjackson [[Frank Jackson]]

You could use an optical illusion so show Mary other colours but induce the experience of seeing red, so when she actually observes red outside the room it's nothing new.

Or if she really knows everything about red, then we would induce the neural activity the causes the experience of red, so she experiences the neural activity of red inside the room, so when she observes red outside the room it's nothing new.


>Jackson himself went on to reject epiphenomenalism and mind–body dualism altogether. He argues that, because when Mary first sees red, she says "Wow!", it must be Mary's qualia that causes her to say "Wow!". This contradicts epiphenomenalism because it involves a conscious state causing an overt speech behavior. Since the Mary's room thought experiment seems to create this contradiction, there must be something wrong with it. Jackson now believes that the physicalist approach (from a perspective of [indirect realism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_and_indirect_realism "Direct and indirect realism")) provides the better explanation. In contrast to epiphenomenalism, Jackson says that the experience of red is entirely contained in the brain, and the experience immediately causes further changes in the brain (e.g. creating memories). This is more [consilient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consilience "Consilience") with neuroscience's understanding of [color vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_vision "Color vision"). Jackson suggests that Mary is simply discovering a new way for her brain to represent qualities that exist in the world.

# Idealism

So you believe in Kastrup's analytical idealism, that means you think the brain obeys the laws of physics. Would different mental activity give rise to different objects, so the mental activity giving rise to a brain is different than that of a computer?

But what if on that computer you run the a simulation of physics of say a brain. That simulation would act just like a real human, and talk about its phenomenal consciousness. But wouldn't the mental activity giving rise to a computer be different than what the simulation is saying it's experiencing?

Does consciousness has causal impact on the brain separate to the laws of physics.  
	1.No. Then it's an epiphenomena. It can't be an epiphenomena since we can talk about our conscious experiences.
	2. Yes. Then it means that electrons in the brain don't act in line with the laws of physics and we could in theory detect it. 

You could also think about what would happen if we just simulated the laws of physics of a person. If like the OP you accept that your theory aligns with the laws of physics, then the simulation would perfectly simulate a human and would talk about their conscious experience. Which would suggest that the conscious experience is fully embedded and explained by the laws of physics, and is substrate independent. It's a type of computation.

Either it does create a subjective experience or it doesn't. Both situations have major issues.

Let's look at the other situation and say it doesn't create a cognitive/phenomenal experience. Then it's a philosophical zombie. Which is a big issue. It would be really weird for a pure simulation of physics, to have something that is talking about its phenomenal experience that it's not actually having. How is that even possible?

Some people don't agree on causal theories of reference. Say process x gives rise to both the statement about x and the phenomenal experience. But wouldn't that mean we are talking about brain state x, and never about our actual epiphenomenal experiences.
