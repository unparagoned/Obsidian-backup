#consciousness

Chalmers defines the hard problem as being unexplainable my materialism.

>The easy problems of consciousness are those that seem directly susceptible to the standard methods of cognitive science, whereby a phenomenon is explained in terms of computational or neural mechanisms. The hard problems are those that seem to resist those methods.

# Idealism

So you believe in Kastrup's analytical idealism, that means you think the brain obeys the laws of physics. Would different mental activity give rise to different objects, so the mental activity giving rise to a brain is different than that of a computer?

But what if on that computer you run the a simulation of physics of say a brain. That simulation would act just like a real human, and talk about its phenomenal consciousness. But wouldn't the mental activity giving rise to a computer be different than what the simulation is saying it's experiencing?

Does consciousness has causal impact on the brain separate to the laws of physics.  
	1.No. Then it's an epiphenomena. It can't be an epiphenomena since we can talk about our conscious experiences.
	2. Yes. Then it means that electrons in the brain don't act in line with the laws of physics and we could in theory detect it. 

You could also think about what would happen if we just simulated the laws of physics of a person. If like the OP you accept that your theory aligns with the laws of physics, then the simulation would perfectly simulate a human and would talk about their conscious experience. Which would suggest that the conscious experience is fully embedded and explained by the laws of physics, and is substrate independent. It's a type of computation.

Some people don't agree on causal theories of reference. Say process x gives rise to both the statement about x and the phenomenal experience. But wouldn't that mean we are talking about brain state x, and never about our actual epiphenomenal experiences.
