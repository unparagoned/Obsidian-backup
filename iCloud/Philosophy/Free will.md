#freewill


Making a voluntary action in line with my desires free from external coercion. 

Not really, but I think we can take insight from how physics uses the word "free". 

You have libertarian free will which is about making decisions free from determinism or the laws of physics, and that doesn't' exist and physics kind of impacts on that kind of free will. But most people don't really mean libertarian free will. 

Studies suggest that most people actually have compatibilist intuitions. A compatibilist definition of free will would be something like "making a decision in line with your desires free from external coercion". So that's making a decision that you want to make and free from someone else trying to influence you. And that kind of free will doesn't really depend on physics.

Where physics is useful in "what do we really mean by the term free". Libertarian free will is trying to say we are free from everything in the world, including the laws of physics. But in actual physics we pretty much never mean "free" in that way, in maths, stats, physics, biology, chemistry, economics, psychology, we always mean free from something in particular. So if in physics we almost never mean free from the laws of physics, why the hell would we use such a definition for free when talking about a high level psychology concept. 


# What do people mean by free will

Lay people have incoherent views around free will, but if you properly probe it lines up more with compatibilist intuitions. 


>In the past decade, a number of empirical researchers have suggested that laypeople have compatibilist intuitions...
In one of the first studies, Nahmias et al. (2006) asked participants to imagine that, in the next century, humans build a supercomputer able to accurately predict future human behavior on the basis of the current state of the world. Participants were then asked to imagine that, in this future, an agent has robbed a bank, as the supercomputer had predicted before he was even born. In this case, 76% of participants answered that this agent acted of his own free will, and 83% answered that he was morally blameworthy. These results suggest that most participants have compatibilist intuitions, since most answered that this agent could act freely and be morally responsible, despite living in a deterministic universe.

>Despite the fact that dualism was most strongly related to general free will beliefs, the latter were at least partly explained by libertarian and compatibilist beliefs as well. Evidently, these theories are not mutually exclusive in the eyes of the general public [23].
[https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0221617](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0221617)

>Our results highlight some inconsistencies of lay beliefs in the general public, by showing explicit agreement with libertarian concepts of free will (especially in the US) and simultaneously showing behavior that is more consistent with compatibilist theories. If participants behaved in a way that was consistent with their libertarian beliefs, we would have expected a negative relation between free will and determinism, but instead we saw a positive relation that is hard to reconcile with libertarian views
[https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0221617](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0221617)

>Results in SGP show some consistency, in that the overall agreement to compatibilist concepts of free will was in line with their response patterns...
Overall, our results suggest that a large part of the general public has libertarian and compatibilist (SGP), or only libertarian (US) intuitions on free will, but behave in a way that is more in line with compatibilist intuitions irrespective whether they are from the US or SGP.>

>Hence, the overall picture suggested by the data is that incompatibilism is not more intuitive than compatibilism.
[https://philpapers.org/archive/NAHIAF.pdf](https://philpapers.org/archive/NAHIAF.pdf)

Most philosophers are compatibilist and it's not by a small amount, about five times as many philosophers are on the compatibilist side vs no free will.

## Free

Free almost never means free from everything, we almost always mean free in a specific respect. So we use the word free in physics, chemistry, biology, psychology, sports, etc. Just like those uses the free in free will, isn't about freedom from determinism.



# Voluntary and involuntary

Just like how voluntary actions can be distinguished at the level of the brain, you could do something similar for free decisions. The brain activity of someone doing something they want to do is going to be completely different than someone doing it because someone is pointing a gun at them and forcing them to.

>The voluntary movement showed activation of the putamen whereas the involuntary movement showed much greater activation of the anterior cingulate cortex
>[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19799883/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19799883/)


>There’s an experience of, of all you know; there’s definitely a difference between voluntary and involuntary action. Between them, there’s a difference that must be conserved by any account of the mind that jettisons free will: you still have to admit there’s a difference between a tremor that I can’t control and a purposeful motor action that I can control and can initiate on demand, which is associated with intentions and has an efferent motor copy that is predictive.

# Justice

You have two people A and B who both smuggle drugs or some other bad crime. One of them was forced to commit the crime otherwise people would kill their family. The other did the crime because they wanted a nice car. Even if you are a hard determinist you would want to treat these two differently, and in in practice the only way to do that is by taking into account the coercion element. So whether you use the term or not, people would use compatibilist free will when it comes to the justice system.



In Powell v Texas, they tried a defence that it wasn't of their own free will since they were an alcoholic. While this argument shows they didn't have libertarian freewill, they did have compatibilist free will, hence they were found guilty.

In R v Ruzic, since they were being coerced, they didn't have compatibilist free will, and hence were acquitted.

>It is a principle of fundamental justice that only voluntary conduct – behaviour that is the product of a free will and controlled body, unhindered by external constraints – should attract the penalty and stigma of criminal liability.

In the case of R. v. Ruzic

>The accused had been coerced by an individual in Colombia to smuggle cocaine into the United States.  He was told that if he did not comply, his wife and child in Colombia would be harmed. 
>[https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/1861/index.do](https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/1861/index.do)

The Supreme Court found that he didn't smuggle the cocaine of his own free will. He didn't do it in line with his desires free from external coercion. Hence they were found not guilty.

>‘**\[a\]ccording to the dominant view in criminal theory, we have a compatibilist criminal law’** (2005: 1158). ... 
>And the most prominent contemporary theorist who has significantly engaged with the free  
>will problem in the context of legal philosophy, Stephen Morse, contends that **‘only** 
>**compatibilism can explain and justify our legal practices’** (2004: 431). He states that   
>compatibilism:   
>is the approach that I and many other criminal lawyers explicitly or implicitly adopt. 
>This approach accepts completely that we live in a thoroughly causal world, at least at 
>the macro level, and that causal processes produce human action and all the other 
>phenomena of the universe. But it also holds that genuine responsibility is possible. 
>This approach best explains and justifies our moral and criminal law practices without 
>endorsing the implausibilities of libertarianism. Even if mechanism is true, the law’s 
>concepts of moral responsibility and deserved blame and punishment are rationally 
>defensible in the compatibilist view (2004: 437-438) 
>[https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract\_id=3237915](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract\_id=3237915)

>Thus criminal responsibility is assessed only when through "free will" a man elects to do evil, and if he is not a free agent, or is unable to choose or to act voluntarily, or to avoid the conduct which constitutes the crime, he is outside the postulate of the law of punishment.

# Libet

Libet has loads of issue. 

>If Libet was right, that should have happened at 500 milliseconds before the movement. But the algorithm couldn’t tell any difference until about only 150 milliseconds before the movement, the time people reported making decisions in Libet’s original experiment.
[https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2019/09/free-will-bereitschaftspotential/597736/](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2019/09/free-will-bereitschaftspotential/597736/)

Libet and other studies, are designed so there is no preplanning, they command people not to act with conscious planning.

Free will is about important decisions, that you consciously think about and deliberate. e.g. is about what career to pursue, not pressing a button. So even if they do show that there is no free will in button pushing it doesn't really mean much. 

Plus it's kind of dualist treating the person and the brain as different things. 

Even Sam Harris wishes they never brought up that argument.

# Effects of weakening freewill belief

It seems like weakening free will belief makes people more prejudice and less moral.


>These three studies suggest that endorsement of the belief in free will can lead to decreased ethnic/racial prejudice compared to denial of the belief in free will.

# Incompatibilists accept we use compatibilism in real life

Here Alex/cosmic sceptic admits that when it comes to courts or daily interactions it's compatibilists free will people use. But he is talking about something different.

>we're talking about Free Will and determinism compatibilism there are different kinds of compatibilists and all that compatibilism is is the compatibility…
>so on a practical level when it comes to our laws when it comes to the way that we interact with each other we can use this Free Will and and I think people do they use the term free will to describe something like that something like your actions coming from within you but if we're interested in philosophy if we're interested in what's actually happening what's really going on

# Sapolsky
[[Robert Sapolsky]]

>Surprisingly, in a book about free will, Sapolsky offers no definition of it (or, for that matter, determinism—or even moral responsibility!
>[https://ndpr.nd.edu/reviews/determined-a-science-of-life-without-free-will/](https://ndpr.nd.edu/reviews/determined-a-science-of-life-without-free-will/)


> And for most people that is necessary and sufficient to conclude that they're seeing free will and action, intent, conscious awareness of you weren't coerced, you had options you did, and I should note that the legal criminal justice system sees that, in most cases as necessary and sufficient for deciding, there was a free choice made. There was culpability, there was responsibility, and so on.
And from my standpoint, this is all very interesting, but it has absolutely nothing
to do with free will.

## Atlantis thought experiment
Sam has this example around Atlantis and redefinition of terms, but I think it's the other way around.

A mum and two kids Sam and Daniel go to this island for a holiday. The two kids see this island in the middle of nowhere and think they have gone to Atlantis for a holiday. To say thanks, the kids find some string and shells on the beach and make their mum a necklace.

Later the mum sits them down to talk to them about the holiday. They talk about how amazing the beach and sea was, etc. The mum realises they think they went to Atlantis, she explains that Atlantis isn't real it's just a myth.

Sam then asks, why didn't you take us on Holiday. The mum confused says I did, you just said how amazing the island we went to was. Sam says, no I was talking about the island, which is Atlantis, and Atlantis doesn't exist, so you didn't take us to an island. The mum asks about her necklace. Sam tries the claim the necklace doesn't exist, because the shells were from Atlantis, which doesn't exist.

Daniel tries to explain that they did really go to an island, it's just that island was Sicily not Atlantis.

Is Sam right in claiming that Daniel is redefining the definition of the island?

In some sense for the kids, maybe Daniel is redefining what the island means. In another sense "the island" has been around for millions of years and has always been a lump of land, not some magical Atlantis. So in another sense Daniel is just using a definition for "the island" which accurately defines what everyone "really" means when they talk about "the island". In some sense Daniel's definition of "the island" is what Sam really means when they talked about "the island".

Lets say 99% of people in the world actually think "the island" means Atlantis, not Sicily. What do those people really mean when they are talking about "the island" they went on holiday to, "Atlantis" or "Sicily"?



# Compatibilist theories

>The three of the most widely discussed contemporary compatibilist theories: mesh theories, reasons-responsive theories, and leeway theories.

>Various models of 'hierarchical' or 'real self theories provide this.B Moral freedom, it is argued, is not simply a matter of being able to act according to your own will, unimpeded by external constraints. It also involves a capacity to reflect on the structure of your own will and form preferences about which desires move you to action. On the basis of a higher-order capacity of this kind agents are able to 'identify' with or 'repudiate' their own will - something that is essential to being capable of moral conduct and an appropriate object of moral sentiment. It is a general capacity of this nature that distinguishes fully responsible human adults from animals and children who (in some degree) do not enjoy such a capacity and thus are not (fully) responsible. The crucial point remains, however, that this sort of higher-capacity involves no contra-causal or libertarian metaphysical commitments.

## Frankfurt

Frankfurt’s hierarchical mesh theory

[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/compatibilism/](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/compatibilism/)

Different order desires line up- Mesh theories, desires mesh up with desires cantered around self.

>One acts of her own free will if and only if her action issues from the will she wants.
[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/compatibilism/](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/compatibilism/)

>More precisely, Frankfurt explains freely willed action in terms of actions that issue from desires that suitably mesh with hierarchically ordered elements of a person’s psychology. The key idea is that a person who acts of her own free will acts from desires that are nested within more encompassing elements of her self. On this view, when a freely willing agent acts, her actions emanate from her rather than from something foreign.
[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/compatibilism/](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/compatibilism/)

>Frankfurt theorized that an agent’s freedom (of the sort required for moral responsibility) consisted in her being able to form second-order volitional desires through which she would identify herself with one desire and distance herself from another. 
[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/compatibilism/supplement.html](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/compatibilism/supplement.html)

This is why it still talks about external coercion, since that's a potential issue with Frankfurt

 In all of these cases—just call them manipulation cases—Frankfurt seems committed to the view that such agents act of their own free will and are morally responsible so long as the appropriate psychological mesh is in place, no matter what sort of (merely apparent) freedom and responsibility-undermining history gave way to an agent’s having that particular mesh.
[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/compatibilism/](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/compatibilism/)

 A free agent is one whose motivational system works in harmony with her valuational system. 
[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/compatibilism/supplement.html](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/compatibilism/supplement.html)

According to one strand within classical compatibilism, freedom is nothing more than an agent’s ability to do what she wishes in the absence of impediments that would otherwise stand in her way.

[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/compatibilism/](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/compatibilism/)>

Frankfurt’s argument was directed against the Principle of Alternative Possibilities (PAP):

PAP: A person is morally responsible for what she does do only if she can do otherwise.

[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/compatibilism/](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/compatibilism/)>

## Reactive

> On Strawson’s view, what it is to hold a person morally responsible for wrong conduct is nothing more than the propensity towards, or the sustaining of, a moral reactive attitude like indignation
[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/compatibilism/](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/compatibilism/)

The Reason View

>In Freedom within Reason (1990), as well as in several provocative papers (1980, 1987), Susan Wolf develops a theory of free will and moral responsibility that highlights a mesh between an agent’s action and what she (correctly) regards as valuable. For Wolf, free will concerns an agent’s ability to act in accord with the True and the Good. Unlike Frankfurt’s, the conditions of Wolf’s mesh theory require an anchor external to the agent’s internal psychological states (the True and the Good). The crucial question for Wolf concerns whether an agent is able to act upon moral reasons. Hence, Wolf embraces the title, The Reason View. A related, though importantly different version of the Reason View has more recently been defended by Nelkin (2011).
[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/compatibilism/](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/compatibilism/)

## Reasons-Responsive Compatibilism

>Agents who are unresponsive to appropriate rational considerations (such as compulsives or neurotics) do not act of their own free wills. But agents who are responsive to some range of rational considerations do.
[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/compatibilism/](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/compatibilism/)

>According to Fischer and Ravizza, an agent’s mechanism is appropriately reasons-responsive, and issues in conduct constitutive of guidance control, only if she has come to own that mechanism by means of a process whereby she takes responsibility for the mechanisms giving rise to her actions (1998, pp. 207–39). On their view, taking responsibility involves a subjective component.
[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/compatibilism/supplement.html](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/compatibilism/supplement.html)

Does response-reason give the right answer for addicts. I think it says that addicts don't have free will, whereas courts won't say addiction doesn't get you off.

Interesting but feels a bit too narrow of a definition.

His freedom must consist partially in his ability to act upon alternatives.
[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/compatibilism/](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/compatibilism/)

>Several contemporary philosophers have advanced Strawsonian themes. For example, Gary Watson (1987) sought to elaborate these themes by thinking of our moral responsibility practices, and in particular the morally reactive attitudes, along the lines of a communication-based theory in which a morally responsible agent’s competence turns in some way upon being a potential interlocutor to moral conversations between her and the moral community in which she operates.
[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/compatibilism/](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/compatibilism/)

## The Action Theory Theory

>According to Mele, weakness of will arises when one’s motivational states become misaligned with one’s judgments about the best (or better) course of action (1995, p. 7). Because, on Mele’s view, evaluations of things one desires can be out of line with the strength of one’s desires for those things, one’s best judgments sometimes are in disharmony with one’s strongest desires (desires that do appear to play a causal role in action)
[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/compatibilism/supplement.html](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/compatibilism/supplement.html)

>Compatibilism without Desert: Wimpy or just Modest?
The hard incompatibilist Derk Pereboom argues that the really important sort of moral responsibility, the sort that has been at issue in the traditional free will debate, is the basic desert entailing kind. It is the kind according to which the wrongdoer who freely does wrong deserves to be blamed just because she has done wrong, and not for any other reason (such as a utilitarian or contractualist sort of reason) (Pereboom, 2001, and Fischer, et. al., 2007). But Pereboom contends that various non-desert entailing kinds of moral responsibility—for the moment let us call them “wimpy” ones—are ones he would be prepared to say are compatible with determinism. [In Pereboom, 2007 (p.86), he explicitly mentions Bok’s view, though various other compatibilists have openly argued for a version of compatibilism that is decoupled from considerations of basic desert, such as Wallace (1994), and Scanlon (1998).]

Libet and other studies, are designed so there is no preplanning, they command people not to act with conscious planning.

Free will is about important decisions, your consciously think about and deliberate. e.g. is about what career to pursue, not pressing a button.

At the end lots of studies or details about where people might give up some of their free will unconsciously or consciously. e.g. milgrim with strong shocks.

We don't always know the factors that control us.

## The Free Will Show Episode 16: Dispositional Compatibilism with Kadri Vihvelin

When visiting a prison the criminal said they committed the crime out of their own free will. But often the criminologists will phrase it in terms of factors not really in line with that. 

Dispositions, we say things like a window is fragile(now). Even though determinism might mean that window isn't going to break. It could break if a rock hits it, even though determinism might mean a rock never hits it. 

Or a rock has the power to break windows, even if it isn't thrown.

\[Incompatiblism\] is intuitively persuasive but that's only because we're not used to thinking in terms of determinism and we get alarmed when we have to think of ourselves as being part of this bigger universe with causes that stretch back in time
