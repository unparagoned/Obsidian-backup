Overall good, but oversells some stuff a bit too much. 






# Notes


[Stuart Phillips, PhD, on Building Muscle with Resistance Exercise and Reassessing Protein Intake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8DSpOd0Nzc)
Most important is exercise
Then protein intake over the day. Timing and source is less important.
Omega 3 prevents muscle wasting

Vigorous exercise has mental performance benefits.
Norwegian 4x4, reversed the heart age of people in the 50s by 20years just after 2 years of exercise, larger/stronger and more flexible. 
Lactate is a messenger and activates various pathways, and signals BDNF
The brain works hard when you are exercising, norepinephrine increases focus, etc. 
Vigorous results in more BDNF
Sauna improves cardio vascular health, blood pressure, etc.  Needed to be in there for 20min x2 a week. Infrared saunas don't show same benefits, probably because they don't get as hot, but maybe could get some benefits if staying for 40min plus. 
Hot baths also have benefits.
Heat-shock proteins keep proteins keep the right shape, it protects against amyloids 
Exercise and heat has some acute "good" inflammation, but the bodies reaction means you have lower overall inflammation.
Cold exposure, increased brown fat, impairs muscle growth. Increases adrenaline in the body and brain. 
#coldexposure
Increased mitochondria in muscle. So can have benefits in cardio sports. 
The evidence around fatty-15 is fairly weak. Maybe it's good but not much good evidence. 
Magnesium citrate, malate, glycinate, 
Magnesium glycinate - both parts help with sleep
