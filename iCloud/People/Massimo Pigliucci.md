If someone insults you
- Maybe they are right and you should accept it, so no need to get mad
- Or the person is wrong and that's his problem not yours. So no reason to get mad.

Reflect but focus on the future, with goals. e.g. Moving forward I want to do x more and y less.

Focus for what's in your control.
