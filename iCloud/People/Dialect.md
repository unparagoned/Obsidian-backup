With difference speeds of light. It's possible to select things such that you have euclidean space and time. 


# Why Can't Matter Travel Faster Than Light? The Problem of Relativistic Mass.

To move a particle, if you hit it with photons. Then you can calculate it's relativistic mass using the energy from that photon. So it's all classical. Can get the relativistic mass classically.
