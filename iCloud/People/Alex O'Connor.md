>Well I can answer the question, but I can answer it at least three different ways. It's a real number, obviously, but there are several different ways to construct the real numbers. I could say sqrt(2) _is_ a certain equivalence class of rational Cauchy sequences, or I could say sqrt(2) _is_ a certain downward-closed set of rationals called a Dedekind cut, or I can say sqrt(2) _is_ a certain function from N to the digits 0-9 which lists its decimal expansion.

>There are many ways to construct the real numbers, but crucially they all behave the exact same way. They all get you isomorphic constructions. Neither answer is better or worse than the others. In fact they're all kinda crap, because the real answer is that sqrt(2) is the real number whose square is 2, and 2 is just the number you get if you add 1 to itself, 1 being the multiplicative identity, the real number such that its product with any other real number is the other number.

>If you were a little number in the real line, the nature of the numbers around you would be obscure to you. Are they Cauchy sequences? Dedekind cuts? Decimal Expansions? Irrelevant and uninteresting. All you would know is how they relate to you and to each other. You see what they do, not what they are, but that's fine, because that's actually the better definition of a thing.

>We exist within reality, as such the fundamental nature of reality is obscure to us. There are many different isomorphic possibilities for what electrons are, so we will never be able to distinguish them. But that's fine. We can do better. We can just define electrons by how they relate to other things in existence. We can name those relations. "waterfall" is just a particularly complicated relationship between the objects in reality.
