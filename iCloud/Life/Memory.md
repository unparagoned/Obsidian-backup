- Layman: Describe things in layman's terms, that links it to what you already know rather than just being something new and unique that doesn't connect to existing knowledge in the brain
- Layering: Focus on what is relevant and familiar, then go back and look at the difficult or unfamiliar stuff. 
- Relevance: Frame how something is relevant.With each layers more and more might be relevant.
- Real estate: Mental capacity to hold onto and process data. Use paper/computer as a cognitive aid rather than trying to keep it all in your head.
