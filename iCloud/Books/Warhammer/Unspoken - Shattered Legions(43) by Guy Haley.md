Set after the disastrous Dropsite Massacre on Isstvan V, “Unspoken” continues the saga of the Shattered Legions—primarily the remnants of the Iron Hands, Salamanders, and Raven Guard. This particular tale focuses on a small band of Salamanders survivors struggling with the catastrophic loss of their Primarch, Vulkan, and the near-destruction of their Legion.  
In the aftermath of betrayal and slaughter, the Salamanders must navigate both the hostile forces of the Traitor Legions and the psychological toll of their defeat. As they strive to protect their fellow survivors and maintain hope amid despair, the story explores the powerful bond between battle-brothers, the weight of legacy, and the unspoken resilience that drives them to fight on. Despite being scattered and leaderless, these Salamanders demonstrate that their resolve—and their loyalty to Vulkan’s ideals—remains unbroken.
