_The Honoured_ is a Horus Heresy Series novella. In the immediate aftermath of the [Word Bearers](https://warhammer40k.fandom.com/wiki/Word_Bearers)’ attack on [Calth](https://warhammer40k.fandom.com/wiki/Calth), survivors from both sides were driven into the subterranean arcology shelters by the tortured Veridian star. While their [Primarch](https://warhammer40k.fandom.com/wiki/Primarch), [Roboute Guilliman](https://warhammer40k.fandom.com/wiki/Roboute_Guilliman), had planned for many seemingly unthinkable eventualities, the [Ultramarines](https://warhammer40k.fandom.com/wiki/Ultramarines) now face a new war in the underworld – could Steloc Aethon, renowned captain of ‘the Honoured 19th’ Company, be the one to lead them to ultimate victory over the traitors? Perhaps, if he can master his own bitter desire for vengeance… Both _The Unburdened_ and _The Honoured_ were also published together as the _Betrayal at Calth_ duology box set, a limited-edition premium version containing hard-back copies of both novellas and additional artwork.
