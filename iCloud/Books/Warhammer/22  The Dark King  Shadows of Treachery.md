7/10 ok, interesting of different perspectives and infighting
 
Curze thinks harsh punishment is required to keep peace.
 
He argues and fights with Dorn, really injuring Dorn.
 
He gets imprisoned but kills all the guards then fires from his fleet destroying all on the planet. To serve as a warning to others.
