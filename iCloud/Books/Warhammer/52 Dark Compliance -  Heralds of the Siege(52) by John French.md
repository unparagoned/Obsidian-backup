In “Dark Compliance,” John French explores the grim reality of worlds subjugated during the Horus Heresy. The story focuses on the concept of “dark compliance”—the brutal process by which Warmaster Horus’s forces coerce planetary populations into siding with his rebellion against the Emperor. Set during the final stages of the Heresy, it shows that not every system falls willingly under the Warmaster’s sway; many are forced or manipulated into compliance through fear, violence, or political machinations.  
The narrative typically follows a representative of Horus’s cause (often an officer, envoy, or Chaos-touched agent) who arrives on a contested world to negotiate—or more accurately, demand—allegiance. Tension builds as local leaders grapple with the impossible choice between defying the Warmaster (and likely facing annihilation) or betraying the Imperium. Through personal encounters and power struggles, “Dark Compliance” reveals the ruthless nature of Horus’s campaign and the moral compromises made by those caught in the conflict. Ultimately, it underscores how desperation, fear, and self-interest can turn loyal Imperial citizens into unwitting accomplices to Chaos, sowing further discord and despair as the Siege of Terra looms.
