Fulgrim and the Emperor's Children
 
Fulgrim ordered them to enhance the gene seed, creating new organs. Which is heresy

Tried to convince ferrus to join them and then destroyed his ships when he refused
 
Fulgrim valued art and beauty above much, but as the whispers of Slaanesh slowly changed him, he and his legion began to indulge in orgies, culminating in a concert which summoned daemons to the stage. This corruption also caused Fulgrim to destroy many Eldar Maiden Worlds, even after a meeting with Eldrad Ulthran. After the Isstvan III war between the Loyalist troops on the ground (including Saul Tarvitz and Lucius), Fugrim travelled to the Isstvan V Drop Site Massacre, and overcame his brother, Ferrus Manus, while he and his brethren, the World Eaters, Sons of Horus and Death Guard slaughtered the Iron Hands, Raven Guard and Salamanders. At the coming of the other traitor Legions, the Night Lords, Iron Warriors, Word Bearers, and Alpha Legion, Fulgrim was indecisive over killing his brother, who he had previously tried to woo to the Horus Heresy, finally gave in to the Daemon who had been tempting him for the entire novel, and beheads Manus.
