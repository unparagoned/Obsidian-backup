Supervisory organisations

European Data Protection Board(EDPR) EU and

[https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/controllers-and-processors/controllers-and-processors/what-are-controllers-and-processors/](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/controllers-and-processors/controllers-and-processors/what-are-controllers-and-processors/)

Key principles

1. Lawfulness, fairness and transparency
2. Purpose limitation
3. Data minimisation
4. Accuracy
5. Storage limitation
6. Integrity and confidentiality
7. Accountability.

[https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/data-protection-principles/a-guide-to-the-data-protection-principles/](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/data-protection-principles/a-guide-to-the-data-protection-principles/)

Legitimate purpose

- Consent
- Contract
- Legal obligation
- Vital interests
- Public task
- Legitimate interests

[https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/lawful-basis/a-guide-to-lawful-basis/](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/lawful-basis/a-guide-to-lawful-basis/)

Special Category data

- Personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin
- Personal data revealing political opinions
- Personal data revealing religious or philosophical beliefs
- Personal data revealing trade union membership
- Genetic data
- Biometric data
- Data concerning health
- Data concerning a person's sex life
- Data concerning a person's sexual orientation

To process special category data you need lawful basis and a separate condition for processing. The condition must be documented.  Conditions like, explicit consent, employment, social security and social protection law, vital interest, etc.

A Data protection impact assessment(DPIA) is needed for any type of processing which is likely to be high risk.

[https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/lawful-basis/a-guide-to-lawful-basis/lawful-basis-for-processing/special-category-data/](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/lawful-basis/a-guide-to-lawful-basis/lawful-basis-for-processing/special-category-data/)

Legitimate interest

- Identify legitimate interest
- Show that the processing is necessary to achieve it.
- Balance it against the individual's interest, rights and freedoms

Legitimate interest might be marketing, fraud prevention, security, etc.

### Accountability

Appropriate measures and records must be in place.

### Article 22

[https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/individual-rights/individual-rights/rights-related-to-automated-decision-making-including-profiling/](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/individual-rights/individual-rights/rights-related-to-automated-decision-making-including-profiling/)

You can only carry out automated decision making if

- Necessary for the entry into or performance of a contract
- Authorised by domestic law applicable to the controller
- Based on the individuals explicit consent.

UK GDPR doesn't not allow solely automated decision making that have legal or similarly significant effect on individuals

[https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/individual-rights/individual-rights/rights-related-to-automated-decision-making-including-profiling/](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/individual-rights/individual-rights/rights-related-to-automated-decision-making-including-profiling/)

### Transfer of data outside the UK

[https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/international-transfers/international-transfers-a-guide/](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/international-transfers/international-transfers-a-guide/)

Can't transfer outside the UK unless there are appropriate safeguards in place. But it's OK if it's transferred to the same company/entity.

### Adequacy regulations

Can be transferred to somewhere covered by "adequacy regulations". So agreements with

EEA

EU or EEA

Gibraltar

Republic of Korea

Countries covered by European Commissions adequacy decisions.

[https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/international-transfers/international-transfers-a-guide/](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/international-transfers/international-transfers-a-guide/)

Partial adequacy for

Cananda only data subject to Personal Information and Electronic Documents Act

Japan - Protection of Personal information

USA - subject to UK Extension to the EU-US Data Privacy framework

### Appropriate safeguards

If it doesn't meet adequacy regulations you can see if it meets "appropriate safegaurds".

Do a transfer risk assessment, which will consider Article 46 mechanisms.

[https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/international-transfers/international-data-transfer-agreement-and-guidance/international-data-transfer-agreement-and-guidance/transfer-risk-assessments/](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/international-transfers/international-data-transfer-agreement-and-guidance/international-data-transfer-agreement-and-guidance/transfer-risk-assessments/)

Article 46

1. A legally binding and enforceable instruments between public authorities or bodies
2. UK binding corporate rules(UK BCR)
3. A contractually binding data protection clauses.
4. An ICO-approved code of conduct
5. Certification under ICO-approved certification scheme
6. Contractual clauses authorised by ICO
7. ICO-authorised administration arrangements between public authorities or bodies

If you can make the data anonymous so that it is never possible to identify individuals it is not personal data.

## The Equality Act(UK)

Should check for any bias, but in particular the protected ones.

### Journal

- Make a list of personal sensitive data according to GDPR.

- Personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin
- Personal data revealing political opinions
- Personal data revealing religious or philosophical beliefs
- Personal data revealing trade union membership
- Genetic data
- Biometric data
- Data concerning health
- Data concerning a person's sex life
- Data concerning a person's sexual orientation

- Make a list of protected characteristics according to the Equality Act.

1. Age
2. Disability
3. Gender reassignment
4. Marriage and civil partnership
5. Pregnancy and maternity
6. Race
7. Religion or belief
8. Sex
9. Sexual orientation

Consider the following questions:

- Why do you think the list of protected characteristics is different to the list of special category personal data?

The equality act is about discrimination against these specific characteristics. GDPR is about personal data that might cause hard in the wrong hands. There is more data that you might want to protect, even if it's not related to a protected characteristic.

- What implications does this have?

You need to consider the specific use case to know what characteristics to consider.

- How might it affect your behaviour as an AI data specialist?

You need to consider the specific use case to know what characteristics to consider.

### Journal

What are your thoughts on these propositions?

- The UK government’s guidance on ethical and safe use of AI protects human rights.

Non-statutory doesn't mean it's enforceable. It might be more practical. People are going to innovate greatly somewhere, that place would be better if it's in the UK than some random place.

- Human rights consideration prevents innovation.

No it ensures standards and prevents a race to the bottom

- The UK needs to put its guidance into law for all AI usage in the UK.

There is no point putting the guidance into law, if that means no AI is made in the UK. It's better for there to be guidance and companies are based and develop AI in the UK

Some parts should but not all of it. So discrimination against protected characteristics, is already covered by legislation.

If there is something bad happening it should apply in general not just be AI specific.
