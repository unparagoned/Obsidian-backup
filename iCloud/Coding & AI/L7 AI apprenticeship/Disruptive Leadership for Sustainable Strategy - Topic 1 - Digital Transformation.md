# Digital Transformation


This topic explores the idea of data-driven digital transformation. It is based on the contents of chapter 1 of the following text: 

- Carruthers, C. and Jackson, P. (2019), Data Driven Business Transformation: How to Disrupt, Innovate and Stay Ahead of the Competition, Wiley

Transformation is a marked change in form, nature or appearance.

Kodak actually invented the first digital camera in 1975, but held back to protect it's film business, which resulted in it failing. It couldn't transform.

Transformation is risky, painful, costly and needs great leadership. So often transformation is often avoided in favour of smaller less useful changes. Or fails since key elements aren't in place.

KPIs to measure progress of the transformation.

Digitisation(conversion) - converting analogue to digital
Digitalisation(the process) - The use of digital technologies to change a business model. 
Digital(effect) - Total and overall societal effect of digitalisation

Some transformations aren't successful since they are focusing on the technology(platforms) rather than data digital transformation, which works from insights from the data.

Data -Raw data, unprocessed.
Three Cs - Collated, curated & contextual data - By data wranglers to a form that can be used by the business and data scientists.
Knowledge - Where SME use the Cs to create knowledge and insight to drive business
Wisdom - Body of wisdom to run the businessI

Data - red light
Information is knowing red sits above amber and green
Knowledge - knowing it's a traffic light
Wisdom - Knowing you need to stop

Enablers for data literacy
- Widespread  and easy access to data
- Leadership onboarding a data culture
- A platform for sharing data, trusted, governed and consistent data.
- Critical thinking.

# Main

### The idea of transformation

* First Industrial Revolution: Mechanisation, steam and water-power mid 18th century to early 19th century
* Second Industrial Revolution: Electricity, assembly lines, mass production. late 19th century to early 20th century
* Third Industrial Revolution: Electronics, computers, internet(mid-late 20th century)
* Fourth Industrial Revolution: Integration of digital technologies, cyber-physical system, AI, Internet of things, renewable energy(early 21century -)

Fourth Industrial Revolution Report in Big Data London 2017, said we need to become data driven

- AI to drive change
- Public service to spend less time on admin
- Dedicated AI Growth Zones to speed up planning for AI infrastructure
- £14bn and 13,250 jobs committed by private tech firms following AI Action plan

A government on the side of AI

### Digitisation, digitalisation, and digital

Digitisation - analog to digital. Paper to digital files
Digitalisation - use of digital technology to improve, automate or change processes and services, e.g. Netflix from DVD to streaming, including tailoring content based on user usage. Or CRM systems.
Digital - the organisation state in which digital technologies, data and connectivity are embedded as a normal part of how an organisation works.. We live in a digital age.

### Data-driven digital transformation

Drivers for data-driven digital transformations
- Competitive advantage. Data might contain insights that will support decision making
- Customer service and personalisation. 
- Operational efficiency. 
- Compliance and regulation. More efficiently managing regulatory data.
- Non-delivery from previous technology driven digitalisation. 

Should be driven by the business with clear business goals and roles of business units.

Business units
- Operations
- Manufacturing
- Service delivery
- Engineering
- Investment
- Financial services
- Human resources
- Procurement
- Finance

Data driven digital transformation is a collaborative effort with engineers, scientists, analysts, and SMEs.

### Executing the data-driven transformation

Want a view of the current state and a vision of the end state, so you can plan steps between them.

Discussion between stakeholders to draw up plans and timescales and work out budget.

Three key ingredients, people, process and technology.  


![[Pasted image 20260119143305.png]]

Data specialists will explain the potential of data to business specialists who will trigger ideas for change, or they might already have some ideas. 

Data driven digital transformations take time, and AI can progress very quickly. So it's important to have a solid overall plan with sustainable architectural design supported by a data governance policy. 

There should be a list of potential use-cases or sub-project proposals where a data-driven transformation looks to make a difference. 

Transformation leaders will create a priority list of the use cases and ongoing schedule of implementation. 

### Further ingredients for successful transformation

- Data governance. Regulatory compliance and ensure data is in the best state to use.
- Visionaries and champions. 
- Data literacy

#### Data governance
Need to know what data we have, so a catalogue.
Some issues

- Multiple sources
- Different versions
- Poor tools for accessing data 
- Lack of trust
- No clear roles responsibilities or ownership
- Problems with volumes
- Integration complexity
- Unpredictable availability
- Lack of governance

Innovative transformation are where the end state is the same but it's more efficient.
Disruptive innovation, changes the business model. It can be harder to sell and is more risky. You can have set timescale and budget to limit any damage from failure.

#### Data literacy
Data scientists needs to know how to apply algorithms  to data to get insights, and a business that can understand and act on those insights.

#### Barriers to transformation

- Not having a clear vision of end state
- Lack of adequate funding
- The wrong people
- The wrong skills
- No culture of transformation
- No data culture
- No time or resource to spare
- Internal or external unexpected factors


Hubble 

- Vision of increased data
- Iterative approach, kind of conflicts with getting funding
- Current tools and systems not suitable, so working to improve them
