Descriptive and inferential stats

Descriptive is like mean, standard deviation, etc.

Inferential hypothesis testing,

CLT might result in some skewedness

Hypothesis what I want to test

Most the time we want a p-value of 5% or less to be statistically significant.

Statistical tests require a normal distribution

Standard deviation of the mean is the standard error

SE = Sd = sd/(n)^1/2

Once you have a z-score or other score, use a table to look up that critical value. Then you can say if it's statistically significant or not.

Alternatively you could calculate the p value and then see if that's lower than the significance level chosen

Hypothesis

Null: The quality of company accounts is not correlated to tax risks

Alternative: The quality of the accounts is correlated to tax risks

Z can be used if we know the standard deviation. If you don't then you can use the t test

T test is often used when the sample size is small

There are different forms of z and t tests.

If t-statistical is lower than critical value, it means the result is not significant

If the statistic is higher than the critical values, you reject the null

Type 1 error, reject a true null hypothesis

Type 2 error, accept a false null hypothesis.

Maybe T.TEST in excel
