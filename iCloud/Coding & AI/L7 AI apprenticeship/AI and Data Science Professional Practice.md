Anne James

Programme leader for the course, will teach a lot of the modules

Professional Practice - Different from other modules. Draws in from professionalism.

Module is for 4 terms, long thin. Along side a technical module, but not that much work

Izzeddin DLC

Should have access to materials for Data Science Principles

Professional practice one module each term

Do the project during the learning period, from Term 1 to Term 5, rather than just during the end.

Learn python for DS/ML during the first term. There are some courses they recommend we do, on the platform.  Need to provide certificate to show we've done course.

Project brief done by term 4, which is the project mainly done in term 5 and written up in end point assessment.

Technical test - is a scenario, with four essay questions to answer. So questions relate to standards, which need to be shown.  Timed closed book exam.

e.g. cashless grocers, give different files, three internal and three external, predict who will be shopping, how to extract the data, how to link the data, how do you deal with ethics and bias, how do you deal with uncertainty, how to store the data, etc. Two algorithms you might use. Legal and ethical. Project team, who to involve, who to include, etc.

Error bias and uncertainty is important when it comes to the technical test

Bud.co.uk QA dashboard

Off job hours - 6 hours a week.

Learning plan, see set activities

Clicks to QA site. Then you can go through those learning, tests, quizes. Need to mark every page as completed

Need to get all the certificates, then submit the certificates on bud.co.uk

Need to log how much time OJH spent

Reviews is progress reviews with DLC

Material for practice is on mimeo

Reflection

Refer to structure and details about logging into MIMEO

Live chat for any issues

Can't submit more than 8 hours at a time

Could just add to OJH rather than submission

Log another 3 hours

Need to hit the hours, but can go over them

PP there are three themes, through bud, read through theme 1 in the first few weeks.

Take a CPD course on python from QA learning platform in term 1

DPS reading Topic 1, they might refer to topic one, so reading topic 1 and 2 before the first workshop should be useful.

Maintain a journal and note learning points against standards

Virtual Learning Envirnment(VLE) is bud

Need to do one, but multiple might be good.
