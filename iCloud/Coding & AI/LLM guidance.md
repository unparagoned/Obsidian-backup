# Structure

## OpenAI prompts
1. Goal
2. Return format
3. Warnings - remind GPT about restrictions, etc.
4. Context - Situation and why you need it to do it



Telling the model to ask questions
- number them
- give a suggested answer 

That makes it easy to response, like 1 yes.



# Sources



# Docker

## Reduce size
The docker images are larger on the server and smaller locally when I run docker images. I did ask directly but this one worked well even though I was asking something else.
