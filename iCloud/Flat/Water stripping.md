How to clean sheets

1. Gather some just-washed laundry, either wet or dry. You can strip wash the laundry either in a clean bathtub, a large bucket, or a top-loading washing machine.

2. Start by filling the tub with very hot water. Then, add a mixture of borax, washing soda, and laundry detergent, following a 1 to 1 to 2 ratio, adjusting the amounts based on how much water you're using. For a tub full, try about 1/4 cup borax, 1/4 cup washing soda, and 1/2 cup detergent.

3. Once the mixture has dissolved, add your laundry. Let the fabric soak until the water has cooled, about 4 hours, stirring occasionally. (This is the fun part where you'll see the dirt and residue come off into the water.)

4. Wring out the fabric as much as possible, then follow up by washing the items once more in the washing machine on a water-only cycle. Ta-da! Enjoy your ultra-clean bed sheets and bath towels.
