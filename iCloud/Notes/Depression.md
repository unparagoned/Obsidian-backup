#depression 


Depression is an umbrella term for a variety of conditions some psychological and some physical.

Your brain needs exercise, good diet and sleep to work properly. Exercise increases levels of BDNF, increases brain volume, improves brain connectivity, improves brain vascularity, improves brain mitochondrial health, lactate levels(which are healthy for the brain),  SGK1 levels, etc. all of which are linked depression.

Very few people have locked down their exercise, diet and sleep, so have a physically impaired brain. It's no surprise that physically impaired brains show up as mental illness. If someone's mental illness is due to to a physically impaired brain then it might be that no amount of "therapy" will help. Therapy isn't going to increase BDNF or increase brain volume.

Depression is an umbrella term for a variety of conditions some psychological and some physical.

Your brain needs exercise, good diet and sleep to work properly. Exercise increases levels of BDNF, increases brain volume, improves mitochondrial health, etc. all of which are linked depression.

Very few people have locked down their exercise, diet and sleep, so have a physically impaired brain. It's no surprise that physically impaired brains show up as mental illness. Which is also supported by the fact exercise is more effective than therapy or drugs in treating depression.

There are going to be all sorts of complex factors and mechanisms, combined with feedback loops.

Depression is likely an umbrella term, for some who have nailed down exercise, diet and sleep it might be more of the traumatic experiences, stress, etc.  that are the main cause that would benefit from therapy and maybe drugs. It's not clear to me that this population would have lower brain volumes.

On the other hand if you have someone who's obese, doesn't exercise and it up all night playing games. Then I suspect the brain markers like volume which be fairly impaired. For this stuff like good exercise, sleep and diet are going to be really effective. This kind of makes sense since how is therapy going to help fix depressions due to low brain volume. If the root cause is brain volume then that makes sense why exercise which helps increase brain volume comes up as good if not better than therapy or drugs to treat depression.

There are probably various potential factors and causes.

You have the more direct root, where say if you don't socialise much then parts of your brain and connections are going to be under used and could potentially atrophy but I don't think there is much evidence there, but I didn't look that hard

Looking through the comments and votes it seems like many people have very unscientific views towards depression.

The brain is just part of the body and needs good diet, sleep an exercise to function properly. If your brain isn't working properly it's not surprising that it might show up as mental illnesses such as depression.

There are lots of studies on this and no pill comes close to the combined benefit of good diet, sleep and exercise.

In fact if you aren't getting good diet, sleep and exercise it might be impossible for pills or therapy to help.

We have studies that show the causal effect of exercise and have a ideas on the mechanisms why

The brain is just part of the body and needs good diet, sleep and exercise to function properly. So they have been linked to bigger brain volume, better vascular, better brain activity, better mitochondrial health, etc. If your brain isn't working properly it's not surprising that it might show up as mental illnesses such as depression.

So I wonder here if exercise has any impact on the parts of the brain they identified.

I'm guessing that the best bet is, sleep diet and exercise, there is a reason studies show that they are as good if not better than drugs and therapy.

Depression is an umbrella term for a variety of conditions some psychological and some physical. So the treatment is going to depend on the cause, although in practice it's likely to be a combination of causes. So a brain in poor physical health is less likely to be able to cope with stressful life events. So I think it's important to take a wholistic approach considering all the different potential factors.

So if the main cause is psychological then stuff like therapy are going to be quite effective. If it's related to the physical health of the brain then exercise, diet and sleep are going to be key.

If nothing works then maybe antidepressants might help, but we aren't really sure how they work. They might be more of a bandaid than something that fixes some underlying issue.

Your brain needs exercise, good diet and sleep to work properly and be biologically healthy. Exercise increases levels of BDNF, increases brain volume, improves brain vascular health, improves brain connectivity, improves mitochondrial health, etc. all of which are linked depression. So if the depression is ultimately due to poor biological brain health, it might be that no amount of therapy or drugs can help. On the other hand if your brain is in good biological health it's much more likely that stuff like therapy is going to effective.

## Exercise

There are good strong causal studies showing that exercise reduces anxiety and depression.

>Aerobic exercises, including jogging, swimming, cycling, walking, gardening, and dancing, **have been proved to reduce anxiety and depression**.3 These improvements in mood are proposed to be caused by exercise-induced increase in blood circulation to the brain and by an influence on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and, thus, on the physiologic reactivity to stress.3 This physiologic influence is probably mediated by the communication of the HPA axis with several regions of the brain, including the limbic system, which controls motivation and mood; the amygdala, which generates fear in response to stress; and the hippocampus, which plays an important part in memory formation as well as in mood and motivation.

>In conclusion, PA is effective for improving depression and anxiety across a very wide range of populations. All PA modes are effective, and higher intensity is associated with greater benefit.

## Diet

There are some studies suggesting that diet has a causal impact of mental health.

>MD interventions appear to have substantial potential for alleviating depressive symptoms in people experiencing major or mild depression.

>The diet may have a significant effect on preventing and treating depression for the individual. A diet that protects and promotes depression should consist of vegetables, fruits, fibre, fish, whole grains, legumes and less added sugar, and processed foods. In the public health nurse’s preventative and health-promoting work, support and assistance with changing people’s dietary habits may be effective in promoting depression.

Researchers discovered that frequent citrus consumption is linked to a 22% lower risk of depression, providing compelling evidence that diet profoundly influences mental health.

Citrus fruits aren’t the only dietary choice that can positively impact your [mental health](https://www.zmescience.com/science/news-science/a-strikingly-high-percentage-of-mental-health-problems-comes-from-childhood-maltreatment/). Other foods have similarly demonstrated mood-enhancing properties:

- [Leafy greens](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6211514/): Spinach, kale, and Swiss chard are rich in folate, a nutrient strongly associated with lower rates of depression.
- [Berries](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11139700/): Blueberries, strawberries, and raspberries contain antioxidants and flavonoids linked to improved cognitive function and reduced depression risk. In fact, berries seem to have an even stronger impact than citrus.
- [Nuts and seeds:](https://www.clinicalnutritionjournal.com/article/S0261-5614%2823%2900246-7/fulltext) Almonds, walnuts, chia, and flax seeds provide essential nutrients and healthy fats that have been associated with improved mental health.

## Sleep

Sleep is really important, if you aren't sleeping properly you have have a tenfold higher risk of depression,

>People with insomnia , for example, may have a tenfold higher risk of developing depression From [https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/depression-and-sleep-understanding-the-connection](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/depression-and-sleep-understanding-the-connection)

## Mechanisms

While we can say with confidence that exercise, diet and sleep have positive causal impacts on mental health, it's not so hard to say anything definitive about the mechanisms.

I suspect that it's likely a combination of mechanisms, here are some that might come into play.

&#x200B;

>The mechanisms underlying the antidepressant effects of exercise remain in debate; however, the efficacy of exercise in decreasing symptoms of depression has been well established

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC474733/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC474733/)

&#x200B;

## Brain volume

I say brain volume, but it's probably just a measure of brain health and might be more of an outcome rather than direct mechanism.

So depression is associated with small brain volume.

>This study shows that a more severe and chronic lifetime disease course in MDD is associated with **reduced volume in brain regions** relevant for executive and cognitive functions and emotion regulation in a large sample of patients representing the broad heterogeneity of MDD disease course.

>[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/da.23260](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/da.23260)

&#x200B;

Sleep, diet and exercise, are all linked mostly causally to brain volume.

>Conclusion: Our results suggest that lower CV fitness and exaggerated exercise BP and HR responses in middle-aged adults are associated with smaller brain volume nearly 2 decades later. Promotion of midlife CV fitness may be an important step towards ensuring healthy brain aging.

## Mitochondrial health

Then you could do something similar for all other potential mechanism like mitochondrial health, etc.

Then exercise is extensively linked to mitochondrial health

>Exercise is one of the most effective strategies to maintain a healthy body and mind, with particular beneficial effects of exercise on promoting brain plasticity, increasing cognition and reducing the risk of cognitive decline and dementia in later life. Moreover, the beneficial effects resulting from increased physical activity occur at different levels of cellular organization, mitochondria being preferential target organelles.

## Reduced inflammation

We have summarised a wide range of research indicating that depression, especially anhedonia, is associated with raised levels of inflammatory cytokines and other markers of inflammation, disrupted dopamine transmission and reward processing and in particular lower propensity to exert both physical and cognitive effort. We propose that this may be an important pathway through which exercise exerts an antidepressant effect. The antidepressant effect of aerobic exercise has been convincingly demonstrated through randomised controlled trials

## General brain health

It might be since exercise keeps the frontoparietal parts of your brain functioning correctly.

We found that the concentration of SCFAs appeared to increase with exercise and that their concentration is positively correlated with physical activity level and cardiorespiratory fitness, suggesting that exercise plays a key role in stimulating the secretion of SCFAs from the muscle-gut axis ([Allen et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666833523000424#bib0002))

Over nine years of follow-up, a multivariate Cox model was utilized on 287,282 participants from UK Biobank to demonstrate the protective roles of seven lifestyle factors and combined lifestyle score on depression. Combining genetic risk and lifestyle category in 197,344 participants, we found that a healthy lifestyle decreased the risk of depression across a population with varied genetic risk. Mendelian randomization confirmed the causal relationship between lifestyle and depression. A broad range of brain regions and peripheral biomarkers were related to lifestyle, including the pallidum, the precentral cortex, triglycerides and C-reactive protein. Structural equation modeling on 18,244 participants revealed underlying neurobiological mechanisms involving lifestyle, brain structure, immunometabolic function, genetics and depression. Together, our findings suggest that adherence to a healthy lifestyle could aid in the prevention of depression.

Sure, that's a good point. While doctors and psychiatrists or people like me might on the surface just say exercise and diet, that's kind of pointless.

So Just telling someone to exercise more isn't probably going to have much impact.

But if rather than it being a throw away line at the end of a session or meeting, you need to spend hours on it and provide good guidance/books then I think that will make a difference.

So what really does exercise do, how does exercise improve depression? You might talk about increased levels of BDNF levels, increased mitochondrial health, improved vascularity, increased brain volume and connectivity. All of which are linked to depression.

So it's super easy to blank out anyway saying exercise will fix your depression. But if someone sits you down and says that exercise increased BDNF levels and helps improve and fix the brain neuron connectivity in the brain. For your brain to work properly and have the right connectivity you need to exercise, 100% of people not exercising have a biologically impaired brain that will show up as some kind of mental impediment/illness of some kind. That if you don't exercise there may never be any pill that can fix that brain connectivity/depression.

So that kind of gives a really good motive and reasoning.

People are constantly told nowadays that's it's all societies fault or your parents fault, etc. If you think you are depressed due to "capitalism", you will never get the motive to exercise. The above might provide some people with the motive, others might need different motive, for some there is no motive that will help.

Then you need methods, tricks or techniques on how to get started. Maybe it's a spreadsheet where you track progress. Start easy maybe it's just doing 30 seconds of exercise a day, do 10 squats, then you tick it as done. Maybe over time you have a target of 15minutes but still keep that minimum level of 30 seconds a day.

Maybe you will use social pressure, send that spreadsheet to a friend once a week.

So sure trying to get a depressed person to do 45minutes of exercise a day straight off does sound a bit unreasonable. But actually for almost all depressed people getting them to do 30 seconds a day does seem more reasonable, getting them to built up a habit isn't impossible.

Then a wider point, most people aren't anywhere as depressed as you suggested.

The majority of people are like the people in the countless studies on depression where they found that exercise does work.

It might be impossible for a few depressed people to exercise, and exercise might not help for some people. But for most people with clinical depression exercise is the best we have.

Evidence that SSRIs dont work for MDD

Here is scientific evidence that SSRIs don't really work for depression

According to the scientific literature, SSRIs are not effective drugs for the treatment of Major Depressive Disorder.

Arguably the best scientific study on the efficacy of SSRIs in the treatment of MDD is a meta analysis by Cipriani 2018:

[Comparative efficacy and acceptability of 21 antidepressant drugs for the acute treatment of adults with major depressive disorder: a systematic review and network meta-analysis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29477251/)

The standardized mean difference (SMD) between antidepressants and placebo was 0.3, which corresponds to a mean difference of approximately 1.97 points on the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17). This small effect size raises questions about the clinical significance of antidepressants, as such a difference may be undetectable in real-world practice.

[The 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale is scored out of 52 points.](https://dcf.psychiatry.ufl.edu/files/2011/05/HAMILTON-DEPRESSION.pdf) Meaning SSRIs only beat placebo on average by less than 2 points, on a 52 point scale. SSRIs only beat placebo by 3.8%...

And the already small 3.8% difference between SSRIs and placebo may be overinflated. This could be due to the enhanced placebo effect.

["Even the small statistical difference between antidepressants and placebos may be an enhanced placebo effect, due to the fact that most patients and doctors in clinical trials successfully break blind."](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4172306/)

So according to Cipriani 2018, SSRIs barely beat placebo, but thankfully in 2019 a study did a reanalysis of Cipriani 2018 and found...

["Several methodological limitations in the evidence base of antidepressants were either unrecognised or underestimated in the systematic review by Cipriani et al. ...](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31248914/)

"The evidence does not support definitive conclusions regarding the benefits of antidepressants for depression in adults. It is unclear whether antidepressants are more efficacious than placebo."

Turns out Cipriani artificially inflated the efficacy of SSRIs, and overreported positive results with publication bias.

According to the scientific literature, based on the best meta analysis of SSRIs and MDD, SSRIs dont work for treating depression.

SSRIs also increase the risk of suicide in children, and SSRIs increase all cause mortality in the elderly.
