>Nowadays, it is generally accepted that the heritability of intelligence increases from about 20% in infancy to perhaps 80% in later adulthood ([Plomin et al. 2014](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7709590/#B17-jintelligence-08-00041); [Plomin and Deary 2015](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7709590/#B16-jintelligence-08-00041))

>The main influence on IQ variation was genetic. Controlled for scale unreliability, additive genetic effects accounted for 67% of the population variance.

>For all four cohorts, in any of the estimated models, social transmission is very small and not significant. Genetic transmission, in turn, seems to be the primary mechanisms of intergenerational transmission of cognitive ability and becomes increasingly important with age.

There is a new meta-analysis of twin studies, just published in Nature by Polderman et al. and it’s huge. The researchers compared 50 years of twin studies to examine to what extent a trait is heritable:

Exercise interventions are associated with improvements in intelligence (including both general and fluid intelligence) in youth.

conscientiousness (C) is the most potent noncognitive construct for occupational performance.

 Results based on a national sample of U.S. children indicates that higher scores for intelligence are associated with more self-control in both cross-sectional and longitudinal models, even when accounting for prior self-control, child executive functioning, maternal intelligence, and maternal self-control. Moreover, the association persisted across both teacher and mother ratings of child self-control. As such, these findings support and extend prior work examining the nexus between intelligence and self-control, and may explain why both traits are important for understanding success across a host of life outcomes in humans.

For the 52 pairs with similar schooling, the average IQ difference was just 5.8 points, and the intraclass correlation was a very high 0.87. 

The most striking finding came from the 10 pairs with “very dissimilar” educational experiences. In this group, the average IQ difference was 15.1 points. This gap is approaching the average difference seen between two randomly selected, unrelated individuals, which is about 17 points. The intraclass correlation for this group dropped to 0.56, a value much closer to what is observed between non-twin siblings. The pattern was clear: as the differences in schooling between the identical twins increased, the differences in their IQ scores also increased substantially.
