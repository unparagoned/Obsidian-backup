Hey...so... thank you for sharing that article about preventing dementia. I grew up lonely and isolated as an only child and I have ADHD. I've put off exercising but not anymore. I'm tearing up, I don't want to lose my mind when I get older. You basically are a catalyst for saving my future and changing my life. So thanks. I sincerely mean it.
