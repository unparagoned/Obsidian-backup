#sleep

While there is a biological aspect to whether you area night owl, the main factors for your circadian rhythm and sleep that result in people being night owls are poor lifestyle, lack of self control, poor sleep habits and poor health habits. When exposed to natural sunlight night owls start waking up earlier more in line with early birds suggesting many people who think they are night owls are actually morning birds but are doing almost everything to fuck up their circadian rhythm. Night owls have higher mortality rates, cancer risk, heart issues, mental health issues, etc. They find forcing a night owl to wake up early reduces depression symptoms and improves physical and mental performance.

## Health and sleep habits linked to chronotype

>People who have a natural preference for staying up late tend to have poorer health habits, including sleep habits, which in turn is associated with reduced wages, according to new research published in Economics and Human Biology.

>Participants reporting a “definite evening” chronotype were 54% (95% CI, 49% to 59%) more likely to have an unhealthy lifestyle than participants reporting a “definite morning” chronotype. A total of 1925 diabetes cases were documented over 469 120 person-years of follow-up. Compared with the “definite morning” chronotype, the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for diabetes was 1.21 (CI, 1.09 to 1.35) for the “intermediate” chronotype and 1.72 (CI, 1.50 to 1.98) for the “definite evening” chronotype after adjustment for sociodemographic factors, shift work, and family history of diabetes.

>While the prevalence of sleep disorders was increasing, several studies have linked diet and physical activity as a cause of it. Indeed, many people complain about their sleeping problems without considering their lifestyle as a cause. This leads the efforts to focus on these principal factors and find their specific effect.

## Light exposure

Night owls go to sleep earlier similar to early birds when just exposed to natural light, showing that for many it's not your biology forcing you to be on tiktok at 2am. It's actually the tiktok usage that makes you a night owl.

>Furthermore, we find that after exposure to only natural light, the internal circadian clock synchronizes to solar time such that the beginning of the internal biological night occurs at sunset and the end of the internal biological night occurs before wake time just after sunrise. In addition, we find that later chronotypes show larger circadian advances when exposed to only natural light, making the timing of their internal clocks in relation to the light-dark cycle more similar to earlier chronotypes.

>The research showed that when teenagers and young adults experience a sense of failing to control their TikTok use, especially when it gets in the way of other responsibilities, they are significantly more likely to postpone going to bed.

>A one-hour increase of screen time after going to bed was associated with 59% higher odds of having symptoms of insomnia and a reduction in sleep duration of 24 minutes.
[https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychiatry/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2025.1548273/full](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychiatry/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2025.1548273/full)

>In villages with electricity, light exposure after sunset was increased, sleep onset was delayed
[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31754265/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31754265/)

>Light exposure affects the circadian system and consequently can affect sleep quality. Only few studies examined this relationship in children. We evaluated associations between light exposure patterns and sleep metrics in children…  These findings further suggest that children may be able to influence their sleep quality by influencing the light exposure patterns during day and night.

>They found that students in the phone ban group experienced notable improvements in their sleep. On average, they were falling asleep 20 minutes faster than before the ban, and reported getting a full hour of extra rest each night.

## Night owls linked to worse mental health

>Individuals with a morning preference who go to bed early (aligned) exhibit better mental health compared to morning-types who go to bed late (misaligned). Those with an evening preference who sleep late (aligned) demonstrate poorer mental health.

>This 2-sample mendelian randomization analysis of data from nearly 840 000 adults of European ancestry found an association between earlier sleep timing patterns and lower risk of major depressive disorder.
[https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/article-abstract/2780428](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/article-abstract/2780428)

When you force evening people to wake up early they are less depressed, do better on mental and physical metrics.

>Overall, participants demonstrated a significant advance of ∼2 h in sleep/wake timings as measured by [actigraphy](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/actigraphy) and circadian phase markers (dim light [melatonin](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/melatonin) onset and peak time of the cortisol awakening response), whilst having no [adverse effect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/adverse-effect) on sleep duration. Notably, the phase advance was accompanied by significant improvements to self-reported depression and stress, as well as improved cognitive (reaction time) and physical (grip strength) performance measures during the typical ‘suboptimal’ morning hours.

## Night owls linked to worse physical health

>Exposure to brighter nights and darker days causes circadian disruption, which accompanies poor health outcomes that increase mortality risk.
[https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2405924121](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2405924121)

>Circadian misalignment through extended light exposure, late-night meals and other environmental factors could [be] driving these cases. Our study suggests that clock disruption, particularly through lifestyle choices, may play a significant role in gut health and, subsequently, cancer risk.”

>Artery calcification is almost twice as common in night owls compared to early birds

## It's not true that different people will be awake throughout the night

People often refer to this study but it's really just talking about people being in light sleep as various points in the night, so is kind of misleading. If you actually look at the graphs in the study you'll see that the difference in sleep times isn't anywhere as extreme as the headline suggest.

>Using actigraphy, we discovered that all subjects were simultaneously scored as asleep for only 18 min in total over 20 days of observation
[https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2017.0967](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2017.0967)

# Sleep
## Lack of sleep is terrible for your health

>Man who didn't sleep for a record 264 hours suffered from crippling effects for years after
[https://www.unilad.com/community/life/man-didnt-sleep-science-project-140654-20231212](https://www.unilad.com/community/life/man-didnt-sleep-science-project-140654-20231212)


In fact you shouldn't be using an alarm to wake yourself up, alarms will wake you up in the middle of sleep cycle which isn't great and can make you feel groggy and by definition they wake you up when your body still needs more sleep.

Sure use an alarm clock to tell you when to get out of bed or as a backup, but you should be going to sleep early enough that you wake up naturally once you've had enough sleep.
## Diet impacts sleep

>This large epidemiological study revealed a statistically significant association between UPF intake and chronic insomnia
[https://www.jandonline.org/article/S2212-2672(24)00094-7/fulltext](https://www.jandonline.org/article/S2212-2672\(24\)00094-7/fulltext)

In animals we have well established the mechanisms and fact that diet impacts sleep

>We also found that the CCHa1 pathway, while critical for gating mechanosensory information, has no influence on how easily the flies wake up when exposed to heat, suggesting that different sensory modalities such as vibration and temperature can be gated independently. Finally, we showed that a higher protein diet also improved the quality of sleep in mice, making them more resistant to mechanical disturbances.

[https://hms.harvard.edu/news/untangling-mystery-sleep](https://hms.harvard.edu/news/untangling-mystery-sleep)

We show that the responsiveness of sleeping flies and mice to mechanical vibrations is better suppressed when the diet is protein rich.

>Higher protein concentration in the gut leads to increased activity of enteroendocrine cells that release the peptide CCHa1. CCHa1 signals to a small group of dopamine neurons in the brain to modulate their activity; the dopaminergic activity regulates the behavioral responsiveness of animals to vibrations. The CCHa1 pathway and dietary proteins do not influence responsiveness to all sensory inputs, showing that during sleep, different information streams can be gated through independent mechanisms.

## Physical activity linked to sleep

>This nationwide study observed an inverse association of gardening with multiple sleep complaints and several individual sleep complaints, in a dose-response manner.

>Our findings suggest that exercise can improve sleep quality without notable adverse effects
>Recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have confirmed that exercise has positive effects on sleep quality, sleep onset latency, total sleep time, sleep efficiency, and insomnia severity ([Passos et al., 2010](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6045928/#ref-54); [Reid et al., 2010](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6045928/#ref-58); [Hartescu, Morgan & Stevinson, 2015](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6045928/#ref-26)).
