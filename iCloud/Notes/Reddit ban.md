I'm guessing due to the current attitudes to crime, they will probably face no real consequences hence will see no reason to change.

In the UK there was the Tavistock clinic which was giving out gender affirming treatments to kids. Many of those kids are now suing the NHS stating that they were just confused kids that shouldn't have been given hormones, etc. What that clinic was doing was criminal and it was shut down.

So I think there is strong clear evidence that giving out treatment willy nilly does cause serious harm. Studies show that some of the effects of hormone treatment can be irreversible.

But on the other hand there are studies showing that overall good treatment can be beneficial, I think one study suggested a reduction in suicide rates of 4%.

I think it might be partially a cost thing, it would take soo much money, time and effort to determine how to help these people in the appropriate ways, that it's almost impossible to do. Which means in practice some are going to get screwed over by either getting treatment they shouldn't get or by getting denied treatment they should get.

It's a lose lose situation, and either side are going to have stats and facts to back up their position.

>Why are some with advantage are being excluded and others with more advantage are allowed.

Because men and women are different in significant ways. Those differences show up as massive differences in the averages.

Women can't compete with men in virtually any sports, so a special safe space is made just for women.

Men with a genetic advantage have a fair advantage and should be able to exploit that advantage.

It's about the advantages men have are soo extreme you need to protect women's spaces in sports.

We don't care about protecting "weak" men's positions in sports. Although you could say that we even do that with leagues and different levels of competition.

>I'd be shocked if she's not retweeting this by the end of the day, tbh.

That would be a big mistake and all it would do is prove and feed into the whole fake media and Trump derrangement syndome narrative.

>She's poking him into unforced errors. While this is a colossal fuckup, it's also because he's panicking.

There is no error or mistake here. Just watch the actual video. No-one with half a brain would think he's calling for authoritarianism and the end of democracy after watching the actual video.

I really hate when people mix up trans and intersex. They are completley different things.

J.K. Rowling attacks another Black cis female athlete with anti-trans hate

.

This kind of transvestigating is often aimed at Black women athletes like Caster Semenya

Funny they mention her. That was a case of intersex.

They targetted Caster since she was intersex. Caster claimed it was all racism, when it wasn't. Sounds like people are literally using an old playbook, that was debunked with Caster.

Got banned over this.

Just so everyone knows this is rage bait. The perfect data is YYYY-MM-DD, they are just trying to make everyone angry with DD/MM/YYYY.

Pretty sure it’s just an opinion, not rage bait

I don't think anyone is really that mentally retarded to think it's the perfect date. /s

But seriously, this meme is always done with the ISO date, the OP has successfully changed it to be controversial to increase engagement.

You’re arguing a cop wouldn’t plant evidence in a high priority case? Especially one where they’re under pressure from basically all the brass.

Yes, particularly for a high profile case like this, where it would almost certainly be found out and for them to end up in jail.

who cares who they plant it on, it’s still the murder weapon, right?

Well then they would have just found some random person in New York.

Also how on the earth are they going to get the gun to Pennsylvania in time after the report? Is it some conspiracy where the person who called the Police was in on it as well? Some massive conspiracy to set someone up some innocent person in another state, for what reason? How did they know the person they set up didn't have an alibi?

I've never seen her define it like that. I've seen the fairly scientific definition around biology around gametes.

That's not true. Stuff like HRT isn't going to change bone structure, lung size, etc.
