Add a small amount of mince, and cook just till just gone grey, don't brown since texture isn't great. But the leftover on the bottom of the pan get the millard reaction. So do lots of batches.

Prepare all the ingredients.

Add some oil to a large pot on medium-high heat. Fry onions and chillis and cumin seeds with one teaspoon of each cumin, turmeric, paprika and hot chilli powder and some salt and pepper for 5 minutes. 

Then add garlic and ginger and fry for 1min.

Put the onion mix into a bowl. (It's easier to brown the meat without the onions in the pot, but you can leave them in there if you want)

Add pork chops and fry until the outside is browned, take out. Then add beef and pork mince. Add one teaspoon of each cumin, turmeric, paprika and hot chilli powder and some salt and pepper.

Break up the mince with a spoon, stir and fry until the outside of the mince is browned.  This usually takes about 5-10 minutes. You want the mince to develop a nice brown color, which adds a lot of flavor to your dish. Avoid stirring too much; let it sit for a bit to get that nice sear.

Drain any excess fat, leaving a little in.(This will depend on how fatty your mince is).

Add back in pork.

Add the onion mix back to the pot.

Add canned tomatoes. Break up tomatoes if using whole instead of chopped.

Add msg and 1 teaspoon of each cumin, turmeric, paprika and hot chilli powder and some salt and pepper.

Add chipotle paste and a few shakes of Worcestershire sauce, Tabasco sauce and Chipotle sauce, a pinch of sugar.

Add half a bottle of red wine or could use red wine jus.

Cook for 10min or so until the red wine has reduced a bit.

Add 380ml beef stock. (You can just add beef stock cube and water directly to the pot)

Add tomato paste

Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer.

Regularly stir and taste. It should initially taste fairly spicey with lots of kick, over time the spice should mellow off a touch and there will be more depth to the flavour.

Cook for 1 hour with the lid off, stirring regularly.

Add a few shakes of Worcestershire sauce, Tabasco sauce and Chipotle sauce, a pinch of sugar cocoa powder and instant coffee.

Add the chilli beans.

Cook for 30min with the lid on.

Take off the lid and cook until desired thickness, you may need to add water if too thick.

Add more Worcestershire sauce, Tabasco sauce, salt or pepper as required.

Taste and season to taste. You want it fairly spicy especially if eating it with rice/sour cream.

Serve, top with coriander, cheese and on the side some sour cream.

Notes:

Tumeric - I use this for health reasons, I'm not sure if it's required in terms of taste.

Tomatoes - Whole canned tomatoes are supposed to be higher quality than chopped, but you'll need to break them up, and it might be easier to just use chopped tomatoes.

Chipolte paste - I'm not sure if maybe this should go in with the garlic, so it's fried a touch.

MSG - Enhances the flavour of the meat. I only added 1/4 teaspoon. I'm not experienced with it so a different amount might be optimal.

When to add spices - Might want to add some of the spices later on when it's closer to done.

Beans - I like getting just a can of beans in chilli sauce. You can add plain kidney beans but I find kidney beans can distract from the taste. I'm unsure of the timing of when to add them, I think earlier is better but most guides say to put them in near the end.

Cheese, sour cream, coriander - unsure of amounts use best judgement

- Mince - Linda Marcathy's veggie mince is pretty good
- Pork chops - chop and fry for a couple minutes till outsides are browned
- Cumin seeds
- Cumin/coriander
- Smoked paprika
- Cayenne pepper
- Salt
- Pepper
- Dark chocolate
- Spoon sugar
- Worcestershire sauce
- Tabasco sauce

## Baking soda

Can be used to add to mince meat beforehand, makes it more juice

¾ teaspoon baking soda

2.5 pounds 85% lean ground beef

1. In a large bowl, combine the beef, salt, baking soda, and 1 tablespoon of water. Using your hands, mix until evenly combined. Let the beef mixture sit on the counter for 20 minutes.

1. Tenderizing: Baking soda raises the pH level of the meat, which makes it harder for the proteins to bond excessively. [This prevents the meat from becoming tough and chewy1](https://www.thekitchn.com/best-ground-beef-baking-soda-tip-23143702)[2](https://lifehacker.com/you-should-add-baking-soda-to-your-ground-meat-1846103865).
2. [Moisture Retention: By altering the pH, baking soda helps the meat retain more moisture, resulting in juicier and more tender meat1](https://www.thekitchn.com/best-ground-beef-baking-soda-tip-23143702)[2](https://lifehacker.com/you-should-add-baking-soda-to-your-ground-meat-1846103865).
3. [Improved Browning: The higher pH also encourages better browning during cooking, enhancing the flavor and appearance of the meat1](https://www.thekitchn.com/best-ground-beef-baking-soda-tip-23143702)[2](https://lifehacker.com/you-should-add-baking-soda-to-your-ground-meat-1846103865).

## Cornstarch

Help thicken but doesn't tenderise just adding to the stew

Maybe not .

Adding a small amount of flour or cornstarch to the stew liquid creates a thickening agent that helps tenderize the meat.

[Adding cornstarch to a stew primarily helps to thicken the liquid rather than tenderize the meat1](https://dishdashboard.com/how-to-make-beef-stew-meat-tender-on-the-stove/). While cornstarch can create a smoother, more cohesive sauce, it doesn’t break down the meat fibers to make them more tender.

Most recipes use the two-stage browning approach: Brown meat cubes first, and then simmer them until tender. But what happens when you rush the process by adding all the meat to the pot at once and crowding the pan? Moisture is exuded faster than it can be evaporated. Rather than searing, you end up simmering and steaming your meat chunks. Instead of taking 10 minutes to brown, you end up blasting your meat with high heat for 20 minutes in order to first drive off that extra moisture. All of this increases the amount of stringy, dry, steamed meat in your final stew. Unless you have a burner the size of a jet engine, you have to brown in small batches, which can take upwards of half an hour for a large batch of stew. Wouldn’t it be great if there were a method that let you minimize the amount of stringy meat in your stew while also creating sufficient browning and being time efficient? Well, there is.

How to Make Stew Meat Tender

When I make stew, I start with a larger, pot roast–sized chunk of meat (usually a trimmed chuck roll or a hunk of pork shoulder) and sear the whole thing in a hot Dutch oven. This minimizes the juices that are forced out and allows me to sear very rapidly and efficiently to get deep, brown colors and flavors on the surface—much deeper than I can get with small chunks.

Only after searing do I cut it into stew-sized chunks. The chunks aren’t browned on all surfaces, but those browned flavor compounds are water soluble, which means that over the course of stewing, they’ll spread around the pot from the more concentrated areas to the less, flavoring every bite.

Once you’re finished simmering, you’ll wind up with incredibly tender, juicy chunks of meat that are deeply meaty with rich, well-browned flavors.
