# Collapse

Say you have a double slit experiment but put polarisers perpendicularly aligned across the slits, the the interference pattern goes away. People often say it's the interaction between the photon and the polariser which collapses the wavefunction. But if the polarisers across a double slit are aligned you get the interference pattern. So you have the photon interacting with the polariser but no collapse, so if that's not it what is it. 

>Only if θ= π/2 do our pair of polarizers act as “which way” detectors. In this case slit “1” will only allow vertically polarized photons to pass through wile slit “2” admits only horizontally polarized photons, so that no interference pattern emerges, as can be seen from eq. (7). For θ ̸= π/2, then a vertically polarized photon can in principle pass through either slit and an interference pattern results; superimposed on this interference pattern for vertically polarized photons is a diﬀraction pattern for horizontally polarized photons which only pass through one slit.

Also the usual experiment people use is the quantum eraser experiment. Where adding a polariser after the perpendicular polarisers brings back the interference pattern. But if the perpendicular polarisers collapsed the wavefunction it should be possible to bring it back.

>Building on a recent result that developed these paradoxes into a no-go theorem, namely the _Local Friendliness Theorem_, we introduce the _Causal Friendliness Paradox_, a time-ordered analogue of it. In this framework, we replace the usual locality assumption with _Axiological Time Symmetry_ (ATS), and show that, when combined with the assumptions of _Absoluteness of Observed Events_ (AOE), _No Retrocausality_ (NRC), and _Screening via Pseudo Events_ (SPE), we obtain a causal inequality. We then show that quantum mechanics violates this inequality and is therefore incompatible with at least one of these assumptions.

You can derive the Born rule, as being the only way probabilities work with certain assumptions

# Basics

Unitary operators are rotations, so <Uo|Uw> = <o|w>, they preserve probabilities. U hermitian = U inverse
