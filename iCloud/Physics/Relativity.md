Time doesn't slow down. It's just how things are measured.
Straight paths are the longest path between two events due to hyperbolic geometry (t^2 - x^2). And faster speeds are shorter paths, so they experience less time. Not that time slow down. 
If you go through curved space time, you go through a shorter path through spacetime, so it looks like the rest of the world is speeding up. 
So if you were travelling close to c for interstellar travel, you are covering less distance in spacetime meaning you can get there faster, compared to someone travelling slower who takes the long path.

# Eternalism and Block Universe

In relativity, there is no objective, universal "now". What one observer considers “now” can correspond to another observer’s past or future. All observers views are equally valid, which means past, present and future can all coexist. Which suggests a block universe.
