#homeautomation

Existing is soo old, nothing updates. ~~The GUI is all gone so, not sure how to update anything anymore.  ~~Can go to http://debra:8080 and click the admin option bottom. Can change things around using the GUI and add new stuff. 

Contintue to use old openhab until it breaks. 

## Temperature Termostat
Slider on habpanel can set temp


## Development
Main folder is /etc/openhab2
Openhab extension for VSCode works well too.
## Migrate?

New one doesn't seem to have a much better GUI. Also the tuya extensions seems to be clumbersome relying on working locally and MITM the connection. 

Seems like a pain to setup my script again.

Try Home Assistant, I think that's where I got the stuff for the script in the first place. So might be more streamlined. Wouldn't boot. Maybe need to run on Raspberry Pi

# Debia
Make sure you get the DVD iso, the min distro couldn't connected to network and has no GUI making it hard to fix things.
