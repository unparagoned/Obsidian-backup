# Sony
Sony headphones had issues with strong sounds.

The inner ears made the beep at BP garage much louder - this was with sound enhanced but it was just way too loud.
The normal headphones make the clicking sound from the toy much louder - with sound cancelling


# Apple
Apples earphones don't have that issue sony had.
