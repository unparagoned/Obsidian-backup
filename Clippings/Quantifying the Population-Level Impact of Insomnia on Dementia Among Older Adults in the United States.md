## Abstract

Background

Insomnia has been identified as a plausible modifiable risk factor for dementia. Quantifying its population-level impact may inform strategies to reduce dementia risk among older adults in the United States.

Methods

We used data from the 2022 National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS) to classify insomnia as sleep-onset insomnia, sleep-maintenance insomnia, or both, and to identify probable dementia using established algorithms. We obtained relative risks from a published meta-analysis. Using these relative risks and NHATS prevalence estimates, we estimated the population attributable fraction (PAF) of dementia cases attributable to insomnia overall and stratified by age and sex.

Results

Among 5,899 participants (44.7% aged ≥ 80 years; 57.9% females; 77.9% non-Hispanic White), 28.7% (95% CI: 26.9%, 30.5%) reported insomnia symptoms and 6.6% (95% CI: 5.9%, 7.3%) had probable dementia. The estimated PAF of probable dementia due to any insomnia was 12.5% (95% CI: 1.0%, 25.0%), and it was slightly higher among females (13.1%, 95% CI: 1.0%, 26.1%) than males (11.6%, 95% CI: 0.9%, 23.3%). The highest PAF was observed in the 65–69 age group (14.4%, 95% CI: 1.1%, 27.8%) among females and in the 70–74 age group (12.8%, 95% CI: 0.9%, 25.8%) among males. An estimated 449,069 (95% CI: 35,049, 923,082) dementia cases in 2022 could have been prevented if insomnia were eliminated.

Conclusions

Approximately 13% of dementia cases, almost half a million cases, among U.S. older adults may be attributable to insomnia. Addressing insomnia could be a promising target for dementia prevention efforts in aging populations.

Accepted manuscripts

Accepted manuscripts are PDF versions of the author’s final manuscript, as accepted for publication by the journal but prior to copyediting or typesetting. They can be cited using the author(s), article title, journal title, year of online publication, and DOI. They will be replaced by the final typeset articles, which may therefore contain changes. The DOI will remain the same throughout.
