## 1\. Introduction

Sleep quality has a profound affect on overall health and wellbeing with deficient sleep now considered a major issue, affecting an estimated 30 % of the global population \[, , \]. Encompassing insufficient sleep, irregular sleep, sleep disturbances, and sleep disorders \[\], sleep deficiencies are associated with the onset and development of several including cardiovascular disease \[\], \[\], and depression \[,\]. Additionally, they are associated with , such as \[\] and \[\]. These negative health outcomes significantly impact the economy through healthcare-related costs and workforce productivity losses \[,\].

L-theanine is a water-soluble, non-proteinogenic found predominantly in the leaves of the (). It makes up nearly 50 % of all amino acids present in tea and accounts for approximately 1–2% of its dried weight \[, , \]. It is absorbed into the bloodstream within approximately 40 min following consumption and is able to cross the blood-brain barrier influencing the levels of several including dopamine, serotonin, , glutamine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) \[,, , , \].

In humans, the consumption of L-theanine exerts several physiological and psychological benefits including lowered blood pressure and heart rate, reduced , enhanced alpha , indicating an increase in relaxation, and stress reduction \[, , , , , \]. More recently, several have investigated the effect of L-theanine consumption on sleep quality showing promising results. Improvements in a number of measures of sleep quality including , sleep efficiency, sleep duration, and daytime dysfunction were identified in both healthy subjects and those with a \[,, , , , , \]. However, these studies differed in several aspects of their design such as treatment duration, concentration of L-theanine, and intervention timing. To the best of our knowledge, there has only been one published that has investigated the effects of L-theanine consumption on psychological stress parameters \[\], while sleep outcomes were not included. Therefore, the aim of this and meta-analysis is to evaluate the effectiveness of L-theanine consumption on sleep outcomes in humans of all ages and .

## 2\. Methods

### 2.2. Selection criteria

Study selection was limited to conducted in humans of all ages, genders and , in any setting where L-theanine was delivered as part of a supplement or beverage (alone or in combination with other compounds), its concentration stated, compared against a comparator and/or placebo, and sleep quality measured using validated instruments. Only articles available in peer-reviewed journals and published in English were included. Studies were excluded if they did not meet the inclusion criteria and if full text was not available. A full list of the selection criteria can be found in the supplementary material (Supp. Material S2.).

### 2.3. Study selection

Following database searches, all articles were exported to Covidence systematic review software (Veritas Health Innovation, Melbourne, Australia) after removing duplicates. Two authors (A.B. and N.D.) independently screened titles and abstracts using Covidence software. Disagreements were resolved by discussion and by a third author (N.N.) if agreement could not be reached.

Articles were excluded based on whether they met the inclusion criteria, and remaining articles were carried forward to full-text review where the selection process was repeated.

### 2.4. Data extraction

Data from articles meeting the inclusion criteria were extracted by one author (A.B.) into a predefined table consisting of author, year of publication, mean age, sample size, experimental and control intervention details (dose, timing, duration), and sleep outcome. Data was cross-checked independently by another author (N.N.) ().

### 2.5. Quality assessment

Quality appraisal of included studies was conducted independently by two authors (A.B. and N.D.) using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool for randomised trials \[\]. Studies were assessed in five domains: random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, and selective reporting bias. Each domain was assessed as being low, some concerns, or high through responses to several signalling questions providing a summative overall risk of bias score \[\]. For studies that used a crossover design, the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 Tool for Crossover trials was used, which includes an additional domain that assesses the result of period and carryover effects \[\]. Disagreements were resolved by discussion between the authors and resolved by a third author (N.N) where needed. Traffic light and summary plots were generated using the RobVis visualisation tool \[\].

### 2.5. Statistical analysis

To evaluate the pooled effect of L-theanine consumption on sleep quality parameters, a random-effects meta-analysis was conducted with restricted on post-intervention means, standard deviations and sample sizes for treatment and control conditions. Sleep quality parameters evaluated included , percent sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, sleep duration, daytime dysfunction score, and overall sleep quality score. Objective measurements of these parameters were evaluated separately to subjective measurements. WebPlot Digitizer (version 4.6, [https://automeris.io/WebPlotDigitizer](https://automeris.io/WebPlotDigitizer), Pacifica, California, USA) was used to convert graphical representations of data into means and standard deviations \[,\]. Reported standard errors (SE) were converted to standard deviation using the calculation SE∗(√sample size) \[\]. Where appropriate, corresponding authors of included studies were contacted to obtain missing data \[\]. Available data was used where authors did not respond after 14 days. Overall means and standard deviations for the intervention and control periods were included for crossover trials and then treated as a parallel trial as per the Cochrane Handbook section 23.2.6 \[\]. Mean difference was calculated for between-group comparisons at post-treatment for pooled studies where sleep parameters were measured in the same units or scale, otherwise, standardised mean difference, calculated as Cohen's d, was used. The effect size direction was coded as positive if the L-theanine treatment group showed greater improvement than the control group. Effect size, 95 % confidence intervals, weight percentage, and P-value for each sleep parameter were represented in Forest Plots. Effect sizes of 0–0.32 were interpreted as small, 0.33–0.55 as moderate and 0.56–1.2 were interpreted as large \[\]. *I* <sup><em>2</em></sup> statistic was used to determine between-study heterogeneity and an *I* <sup><em>2</em></sup> > 50 % was considered as having high heterogeneity \[\]. Publication bias was assessed *via* Egger's weighted regression test and visual asymmetry. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine the influence of single study removal on the pooled effect size. Post-hoc subgroup analysis assessed the influence of the type of randomised controlled trial (RCT) (crossover and parallel), dose (<200 mg and ≥200 mg or greater), duration (<4 weeks and ≥4 weeks), intervention type (theanine only and blend) and timing (morning, evening, morning and evening) on the outcome to determine optimal treatment conditions. All statistical analyses were conducted in RStudio IDE \[\] using R Statistical Software (v4.3.1; R Core Team and (‘meta’) \[\], (‘metafor’) \[\], and (‘dmetar’) \[\] packages. An outcome of *p* < 0.05 was considered statistically significant \[,\].

## 3\. Results

A total of 2763 articles were retrieved. Seventeen articles were selected after removing duplicates and applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria. An additional two articles \[,\] were identified from the references of included studies and review articles (). Therefore, a total of nineteen articles were included in this systematic review \[, , , , ,, , , , , , , , , , , , , \]. Due to insufficient data in one study \[\], eighteen studies were included in the meta-analysis \[, , , , ,, , , ,, , , , , , , , \].

### 3.1. Study characteristics

Among the nineteen included studies, ten were crossover \[,,, , , , , , ,\] and nine were parallel trials \[, , ,,,, , , \]. The total sample size of the included studies was 897 (9–113 participants) with a mean age range of 10–53.6 years. In eleven studies, L-theanine was a component of a beverage or capsule containing other ingredients \[,,,,, , , , ,,\], whereas eight studies compared L-theanine alone in a capsule, tablet, or beverage \[,,,,,,,\]. Deficient sleep was an eligibility requirement in eight studies \[,,,,, , ,\] with a score ≥5 and ISI score >8 being the most widely used indicator.

The timing of the products (treatment and placebo) varied with consumption in the evening \[, , ,,,,,,, , ,\]; twice per day \[,,\]; morning \[,\]; evening or morning \[\]; and four times throughout the day \[\]. Duration of the interventions ranged from one night to eight weeks, with the daily concentration of L-theanine consumed ranging from 50 to 1000 mg. In one study, the initial concentration was 450 mg in the first four weeks; however, this was titrated up to a maximum dose of 900 mg if a reduction in anxiety score criteria was not met after four weeks \[\]. A concentration of 1000 mg L-theanine was used as a “least optimal” comparator in one study \[\].

were monitored in fourteen studies \[, , , , ,,,,,,,,,\]. One study stated “no serious adverse events were reported until the end of the study” but no further information was provided \[\]. Five studies did not record adverse events \[,,,,\] (Supp. Material S4).

### 3.2. Quality assessment

The majority of studies had a low overall risk of bias \[,,,, , ,,, , , \]. Seven studies had an overall risk of bias of some concern \[, , , ,,,\]. Individual domain results revealed some concerns with the randomisation process \[,,\], deviations from the intended intervention \[,,,\], missing outcome data \[,\], measurement of the outcome \[\], selection of reported results \[, , ,\], and period and carryover effects for \[,,\]. One study had a high overall risk of bias as a result of several individual domains with some concerns (randomisation process, assignment to intervention, and outcome measurement domains) and one domain with a high risk of bias (missing outcome data domain) \[\]. Visualisation of the quality assessment is available in the . and b) while the period and carryover domain for the crossover trials is available in supplementary material (Supp. Material S4c).

### 3.3. Subjective sleep onset latency score

Ten studies reported data for subjective sleep onset latency score \[, , ,,,,, , ,\]. A significant improvement in favour of the treatment was found (SMD = 0.15, 95 % CI \[0.01, 0.29\], *p* = 0.04; ). No between-study heterogeneity was identified (*I* <sup><em>2</em></sup> = 0.0 %) and sensitivity analysis revealed that the removal of five studies \[,,,,\] resulted in the outcome no longer being significant (Supp. Material S5c).

### 3.12. Overall sleep quality score

Twelve studies reported data for the effects of L-theanine consumption on overall sleep quality score \[, , ,,,,, , , , ,\]. Analysis found a significant effect on overall sleep quality score in favour of the treatment (SMD = 0.43, 95 % CI \[0.04, 0.83\], *p* = 0.03; .). A high between-study heterogeneity was observed for the studies (*I* <sup><em>2</em></sup> = 82.9 %) and sensitivity analysis revealed that one study \[\] was the source (SMD = 2.58, 95 % CI \[1.96, 3.21\]). Removal of this study resulted in a reduction in the effect from moderate to small, although it still remained significant (SMD = 0.21, 95 % CI \[0.08, 0.35\], *p*  < 0.01; *I* <sup><em>2</em></sup> = 6.1 %).

### 3.13. Publication bias

Publication bias *via* asymmetry in the was detected for objective sleep onset latency, objective sleep efficiency, subjective sleep disturbances, and subjective sleep duration (a, S9a, and S11a).

### 3.14. Subgroup analysis

Subgroup analysis found agreement between subjective sleep onset latency, subjective sleep disturbances, and daytime dysfunction for the dose “<200 mg” subgroup (Supp. Material S5d and S13d.). Agreement was found between subjective sleep disturbances, daytime dysfunction and overall sleep quality for the RCT “Parallel” subgroup (Supp. Material S9d, S13d, and S14d.). Lastly, agreement was found between daytime dysfunction and overall sleep quality for the intervention type “Theanine only” subgroup (Supp. Material S13d, and S14d.). These agreements also showed either a high between-study heterogeneity or uneven study distribution.

### 3.15. Secondary outcomes

L-theanine was found to have mixed effects on the secondary outcomes. In the studies that measured depression, stress and anxiety using questionnaires, some found significant improvement in scores \[,,,,\], whereas, some found no significant improvement \[,,,\]. For the , two studies reported significant improvements \[,\]. One study only reported improvements in some cognitive functions scores that were measured \[\].

No significant improvement was found for salivary , blood pressure or HRV.

Sleep regulation metabolites were measured in urine in one study \[\] where a significant increase in 6-sulfoxymelatonin and D-serine (sleep promoting) and a significant downregulation of L-glutamic acid (wake promoting) metabolites were found.

### 3.16. Adverse events

The interventions containing L-theanine were well tolerated with or migraine, and the most frequently reported symptoms. One study reported symptoms including sleep disturbances, drowsiness, fatigue, irritability and trouble concentrating \[\]. In this study, participants were consuming 450 mg L-THE/day (with some consuming up to 900 mg L-THE/day. No significant difference was found between the intervention group and the placebo group, including those titrated to 900 mg/day L-THE.

All reported symptoms resolved quickly and without medical attention.

## 4\. Discussion

This review evaluated the effect of L-theanine consumption on sleep outcomes using pooled data from previously published randomised controlled trials. Meta-analysis results found that treatments containing L-theanine improved subjective sleep onset latency, daytime dysfunction, and overall subjective sleep quality scores, with a moderate improvement in the latter two parameters. No significant improvement was found for objective sleep onset latency or subjective and objective sleep efficiency, sleep duration, and sleep disturbances. These results suggest a role for L-theanine in the management of sleep disturbances. However, several limitations must be considered when drawing conclusions from these findings.

Firstly, eleven of the included studies \[,,,,, , , , ,,\] combined L-theanine with other ingredients, therefore, the observed outcomes cannot be solely attributed to L-theanine alone. Secondly, the limited treatment effect may be a result of variation amongst the included studies, including the concentrations of L-theanine used (50 mg–1000 mg per day); timings of the interventions (once to four times per day); and duration of the intervention (one night to eight weeks). Furthermore, differences in individual results were observed in studies of similar dose and duration, irrespective of whether sleep was measured using subjective or objective assessments.

Similar results have been observed in the literature in relation to dose response effects of L-theanine. In a study by Dassanayake et al., 2023 \[\], acute consumption of 100 mg and 200 mg, but not 400 mg, of L-theanine significantly improved visuomotor speed and sustained attention compared to placebo \[\]. Whereas, in the previous study conducted by same authors \[\] found 400 mg of L-theanine, but not 100 mg or 200 mg, was effective at improving attention processing in response to an \[\].

The populations studied in this review were mostly healthy adults without sleep disturbances, potentially leaving only a small level of improvement possible, if any at all. This is evident in the wide confidence intervals observed ranging from very small to no effect to a moderate to large effect.

Only four studies were conducted in clinical populations that included healthy adults with chronic stress (N = 1), healthy adults with GAD (N = 1), and two studies in children with \[\] and ASC \[\]). The study conducted in adults with chronic stress reported no significant treatment effects, however, L-theanine was in combination with other ingredients (125 mg green tea extract) \[\]. The study conducted in adults with GAD \[\] had a greater improvement in self-rated sleep satisfaction if they did not meet the criteria for clinical insomnia. Additionally, participants with a lower baseline anxiety score responded better to L-theanine treatment than those with a higher score \[\]. These outcomes are in contrast to other studies conducted in clinical populations including reported improvements in sleep quality in adults with chronic schizophrenia following an 8-week intervention (250 mg/d) \[\]. Similarly, a study in adults with reported improvements in sleep quality also following an 8-week intervention (250 mg/d) \[\].

The study conducted in children with ADHD \[\] may have affected the outcomes of the analysis as children have different sleep requirements to adults \[\]. However, children with ADHD typically experience sleep disturbances such as increases in sleep onset latency, wake bouts and activity bouts during the night \[\]. Managing sleep disturbances in this population can also have positive effects on their daytime behaviour \[\].

Finally, a relatively recent systematic review \[\] proposed that levels between 200 mg and 400 mg of L-theanine were optimal for reducing stress and anxiety \[\]. However, in our subgroup analyses, results suggest <200 mg is an optimal concentration, although there were only a small number of studies in each of the subgroup analysis performed. Together with the secondary outcomes analysis, this indicates that L-theanine could improve sleep quality by reducing stress and anxiety, however, this needs to be further explored looking at the timing of the intervention either in the morning and evening to subdue stress levels over the course of the day.

It is important to note that interventions containing L-theanine were well tolerated and that all reported symptoms resolved quickly and without medical treatment, indicating a benefit of its use compared to conventional sleep aids that can have detrimental .

### 4.1. Limitations of the study

Although our findings are somewhat consistent with previous studies in the literature, we acknowledge several limitations of this review.

Firstly, the statistical power to detect publication bias and optimal concentrations as a result of subgroup analysis was reduced. Wide confidence intervals were observed in the outcomes, posing an uncertainty that the observed effect may not truly represent the effectiveness of L-theanine. Sleep architecture parameters were not evaluated in this analysis due to insufficient data. Four studies used objective measures that could determine sleep stages including EEG \[,,\] and PSG \[\]. However, only one reported all parameters in minutes \[\], one reported results in percentage \[\], one only reported time to \[\] and two did not evaluate the sleep stages \[,\]. A further limitation is the introduction of a unit-of-analysis error from data reported in the crossover trials (N = 8) as a result of overall means and standard deviations for intervention and control groups were reported rather than data from each period.

Despite these limitations, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of L-theanine consumption on sleep quality. It highlights the limited evidence investigating the effectiveness of “pure” L-theanine on sleep quality parameters as well as studies conducted in clinical populations who may benefit. Therefore, further studies in both healthy and clinical populations are warranted, particularly as current international guidelines do not recommend these type of supplements for the treatment of insomnia due to the lack of available evidence \[\].

## 5\. Conclusion

Despite a lack of improvement observed in the objective sleep measures, positive effects of L-theanine supplementation were observed on subjective measures for sleep onset latency, daytime dysfunction, and overall sleep quality. The findings of this review show the potential for L-theanine supplementation as a treatment option for the management of sleep disturbances. However, due to the limited number of studies investigating “pure” L-theanine and the variations in study design further investigation is warranted using a well-designed dose response trial in healthy and clinical populations with sleep disturbances.

- 1.
	Future studies should investigate the dose response effects of “pure” L-theanine in both healthy and clinical populations (including children) with sleep disturbances.
- 2.
	Future studies should investigate the effect of “pure” L-theanine on sleep stages.
- 3.
	Studies should be of similar methodology in relation to timing and duration of the intervention.
- 4.
	Studies should include both subjective and objective sleep assessment measures.

- 1.
	The effectiveness of “pure” L-theanine for the management of sleep disturbances is not well known.
- 2.
	Findings suggest L-theanine could be useful for improving SOL, daytime dysfunction, and overall sleep quality.
- 3.
	This review highlights the lack of studies investigating “pure” L-theanine for managing sleep disturbances and its effects on all stages of sleep.
