description: "This first paper in a three-part Lancet Series combines narrative and systematic reviewswith original analyses and meta-analyses to assess three hypotheses concerning a dietarypattern based on ultra-processed foods. The first hypothesis—that this pattern isglobally displacing long-established diets centred on whole foods and their culinarypreparation as dishes and meals—is supported by decades of national food intake andpurchase surveys, and recent global sales data. The second—that this pattern resultsin deterioration of diet quality, especially in relation to chronic disease prevention—isconfirmed by national food intake surveys, large cohorts, and interventional studiesshowing gross nutrient imbalances; overeating driven by high energy density, hyper-palatability,soft texture, and disrupted food matrices; reduced intake of health-protective phytochemicals;and increased intake of toxic compounds, endocrine disruptors, and potentially harmfulclasses and mixtures of food additives."

he totality of the evidence supports the thesis that displacement of long-established dietary patterns by ultra-processed foods is a key driver of the escalating global burden of multiple diet-related chronic diseases.
