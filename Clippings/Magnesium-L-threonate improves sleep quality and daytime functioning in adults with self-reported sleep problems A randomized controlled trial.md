## Abstract

**Objective/background:** Sleep problems challenge overall wellbeing. Magnesium has been implicated to benefit sleep, although the clinical evidences varied based on the magnesium source used. Magnesium L-threonate (MgT) is a promising intervention due to its brain bioavailability and effects on cognition, memory and mood. We investigated MgT supplementation on sleep quality and daily function.

**Patients/methods:** Eighty 35-55-year-olds with self-assessed sleep problems participated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm study, taking 1 g/day of MgT or placebo for 21 days. Sleep and daily behaviors were measured subjectively using standardized questionnaires including the Insomnia Severity Index, Leeds Sleep Evaluation Questionnaire, and Restorative Sleep Questionnaire, and objectively using an Oura ring. The Profile of Mood States questionnaire and a daily diary were used to evaluate mood, energy and productivity, and record any safety concerns.

**Results:** The MgT group maintained good sleep quality and daytime functioning, while placebo declined. From objective Oura ring measurements, MgT significantly (p < 0.05) improved *vs* placebo deep sleep score, REM sleep score, light sleep time, and activity and readiness parameters activity score, activity daily movement score, readiness score, readiness activity balance, and readiness sleep balance. From subjective questionnaires, MgT significantly (p < 0.05) improved *vs* placebo behavior upon awakening, energy and daytime productivity, grouchiness, mood and mental alertness. MgT was safe and well tolerated.

**Conclusions:** This showed MgT improved sleep quality, especially deep/REM sleep stages, improved mood, energy, alertness, and daily activity and productivity. These are consistent with how MgT works in neuron cells and animal models, suggesting broader positive impacts on overall brain health.

**Keywords:** Energy; Magnesium; Magnesium L-threonate; Mental alertness; Mood; Sleep; Threonate.
