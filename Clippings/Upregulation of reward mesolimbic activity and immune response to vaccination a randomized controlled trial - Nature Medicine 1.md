## Abstract

Growing evidence points to a close neurophysiological link between brain and body. Recent rodent studies have shown that the dopaminergic mesolimbic pathway, which underlies expectations of positive outcomes, also modulates immune function. However, it remains unknown whether a similar brain-immune link exists in humans and whether it involves conscious positive expectations. In a preregistered, double-blind randomized controlled trial, we used fMRI neurofeedback (NF) to train healthy participants to increase reward mesolimbic activity through self-chosen mental strategies, followed by an immune challenge with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccine and assessments of HBV antibody (HBVab) levels. Eighty-five participants were randomized to (1) reward mesolimbic upregulation (*n*  = 34), (2) non-mesolimbic control upregulation (*n*  = 34) or (3) no-NF control (*n*  = 17). Prespecified primary outcomes were (1) differences in reward mesolimbic activation between NF groups, (2) correlation between reward mesolimbic upregulation and post-vaccination HBVab changes across both NF groups and (3) group differences in post-vaccination HBVab changes. Both NF groups showed significant increases in reward mesolimbic activation. Notably, greater ventral tegmental area (VTA) upregulation—but not nucleus accumbens or control region activation—was associated with larger post-vaccination increases in HBVab levels (*r*  = 0.31, *P*  = 0.018). Sustained VTA upregulation was further linked to mental strategies involving positive expectations. Post-vaccination antibody levels did not differ between groups, and no adverse effects occurred. Together, these findings suggest that consciously generated positive expectations can engage reward circuitry to influence immune function, a process that may be leveraged for non-invasive immune modulation.

## Extended data

### Extended Data Fig. 1 Offline functional localization of the reward mesolimbic network. a. Reward anticipation contrast map.

Whole-brain results for the high vs neutral reward anticipation contrast during the Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) task. The overlaid predefined meta-analytic masks of the mesolimbic system, taken from refs. [^57] [^66], are shown in white. Abbreviations: Nucleus Accumbens (Nac); Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA). Statistical threshold was set at a cluster-level p(Few) <.05. **b. ROIs of the reward mesolimbic network**. The offline functional localization of the reward mesolimbic regions. For the VTA, the predefined anatomical mask [^57] was intersected with the high>neutral reward anticipation maps presented in A. For the bilateral Nac, a 5 mm sphere was created around the peak activation voxel within the 8 mm predefined Nac masks (defined based on reward anticipation meta-analysis [^66]).

### Extended Data Fig. 2 Randomized Network control condition.

**a. Conceptual scheme**. In randomized ROI-NF, each participant is randomly assigned to one of K subgroups of different functionally defined neural targets (colored in pink, orange, and yellow). While in each sub-group, a specific neural target is modulated along with the general task processes (colored in green – control, learning and reward processes), group-level modulations (right panel) include only the averaged (non-specific) general processes common to all subgroups (that is the target process specific to each subgroup is averaged over the whole group). Conversely, in a typical experimental NF group, all participants modulate both the general and target processes (colored in green and blue, respectively). Therefore, group-level modulations include both the general processes and the reoccurring target process modulations. Consequently, differences in outcome effects (such as immune function) between groups can be attributed solely to the target-specific effects (Figure adapted from ref. [^10]). **b. Neural networks of subgroups**. Targets of the randomized ROI-NF control condition. All target networks were selected from meta-analyses of fMRI studies on specific functional processes. MNI coordinates: T1. Spatial navigation network [^76]: right medial temporal lobe: 26, -35, -11; left medial temporal lobe: -26, -47, -9; left posterior cingulate: -15, -59, 19; T2. Arithmetic processing network [^77]: right SPL: 29, -66, 49; left dlpfc: -45, 32, 29; left precuneus: -28, -71, 33; T3; Motor imagery network [^78]: right cerebellum: 32, -62, -28; left cerebellum: -32, -56, -30; left precentral gyrus: -26, -2, 58; T4. Auditory imagery network [^79]: right STG:64, -30, 9; left IFG: -48, 24, −5; left precentral gyrus: -52 1 47.

### Extended Data Fig. 3 Mental Strategies Questionnaire for Neurofeedback (MSQ-NF).

Following practice, participants fill out the MSQ-NF for each strategy applied during the session, based on their logged choices during training. “Other” strategies, as well as those with predefined names, are verbally described, and then each strategy is labeled across the MSQ space.

### Extended Data Fig. 4 BOLD activity during the last NF session across conditions and groups.

**a. Upregulate>Rest** contrast, showing differing regulation effects per group (reward ml NF – light blue, randomized ROI NF – pink). **b. Feedback** contrast. **c. Choice** contrast. Abbreviations: right Insula (r Ins); subgenual ACC (sgACC); Thalamus (Thal), ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmpfc). The VTA and bilateral Nac ROIs are overlaid in white.
