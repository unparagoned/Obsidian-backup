## Abstract

Ample sleep is an important basis for maintaining health, however with the pace of life accelerating in modern society, more people are using sacrificial sleep to cope with these social changes. Sleep deprivation can have negative effects on cognitive performance and psychosomatic health. It is well known that exercise, as a beneficial intervention strategy for human health, has been increasingly used in the clinic. But it's not clear if it can prevent the negative effects of sleep deprivation. In this meta-analysis, we reviewed 23 articles from PubMed and Web of Science to investigate whether moderate physical exercise can prevent the negative effects of sleep deprivation in rodents. Our findings suggest that exercise can prevent sleep deprivation-induced cognitive impairment and anxiety-like behaviors through multiple pathways. We also discuss possible molecular mechanisms involved in this protective effect, highlighting the potential of exercise as a preventive or therapeutic strategy for sleep deprivation-induced negative effects.

**Keywords:** Anxiety; Cognitive impairment; Exercise; Psychosomatic health; Sleep deprivation.
