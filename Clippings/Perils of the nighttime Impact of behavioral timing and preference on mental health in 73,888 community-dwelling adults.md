## Introduction

The central human circadian clock, located in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), drives various 24-hour behaviors, predicting environmental changes and coordinating a myriad of downstream oscillators (Moore and Eichler, 1972). One of the most observable behaviors under the influence of the SCN is the timing of sleep. While humans are diurnal (day-active), the precise timing of nocturnal sleep among individuals can vary considerably due to both biological preference and expressed behavior.

Even though the biochemical underpinnings are not well understood, the preference for going to sleep later ('owl') or earlier ('lark') is a phenomenon known as chronotype or "morningness"-"eveningness" (Horne and Östberg, 1976). Chronotype has been independently associated with susceptibility to a variety of mental disorders (Díaz-Morales and Sánchez-Lopez, 2008; Konttinen et al., 2014; Lemoine et al., 2013), such that having a morning preference is associated with better mental health outcomes (Jones et al., 2019). While humans may prefer a specific time to sleep, life may interfere with such plans, causing people to sleep later or earlier than they might otherwise prefer. As with chronotype, going to sleep later and earlier has also been associated with susceptibility to various mental disorders (Bradley et al., 2017; Helgadóttir et al., 2015). A smaller number of studies have looked at the synchrony between the preference for sleep timing and the exhibited timing of sleep. These studies have shown that worse mental health outcomes are associated with such a misalignment (Levandovski et al., 2011). Results of these studies, however, need to be validated in a larger sample size and across an array of disorders.

The goal of this study is to examine the impact of chronotype, actual sleep timing, and the alignment between the two on Mental, Behavioral and Neurodevelopmental (MBN) disorders, depression and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), as these disorders are widely prevalent and have been linked to sleep and circadian disturbances. Our *a priori* hypothesis was that aligning chronotype with the timing of behavior (e.g., morning chronotype with an early timing of behavior, intermediate chronotype with an intermediate timing of behavior, and late chronotype with a late timing of behavior) positively impacts mental health. To assess this hypothesis, we analyzed data from participants in the UK Biobank—a large, community-dwelling cohort of middle-aged and older adults. Our investigation employed cross-sectional (odds-ratio tests) and longitudinal (survival analysis) approaches.

## Ethics

This study was covered by the general ethical approval for UK Biobank studies from the NHS National Research Ethics Service on the 17th of June 2011 (Ref 11/NW/0382). There were no attempts to identify any of the participants and data were kept secure and only used for the purpose of the approved research, as per the material transfer agreement (Sudlow et al., 2015). This study is reported as per the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guideline (Table

## Sample characteristics

The UK Biobank includes community-dwelling adults residing in the United Kingdom. Following exclusions for missing data (Fig. 1), we had a final sample (*n* = 73,888) that was 56 % female, 63.5 \[56.3, 68.6\] years in age, with a Body Mass Index of 26.0 \[23.6, 29.0\] and a Townsend Deprivation Index of −2.45 \[−3.82, −0.17\]. Self-reported sleep duration was 7 \[6, 8\] hours, with an Interdaily Stability (IS) of 0.550 \[0.460, 0.630\]. Accelerometers were worn for a minimum of 5 and a maximum of 7 days

## Discussion

While our *a priori* hypothesis was an expectation of better mental health in individuals whose sleep patterns match their preferred sleep time (chronotype), our analysis of 73,888 adults indicates that for all chronotypes, having an earlier sleep schedule is better for mental health.

The association between evening preference and mental health disorders has been previously assessed (Díaz-Morales and Sánchez-Lopez, 2008; Konttinen et al., 2014; Lemoine et al., 2013), and is particularly profound
