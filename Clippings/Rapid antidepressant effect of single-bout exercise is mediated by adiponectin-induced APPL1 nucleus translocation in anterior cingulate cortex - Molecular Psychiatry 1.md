## Abstract

Emerging evidence suggests that a single bout of physical exercise can induce rapid antidepressant effects, yet the underlying neural mechanisms remain largely unknown. We established a mouse model designed to mimic the mood-elevating effects of acute exercise observed in humans. We found that this rapid antidepressant response in exercised mice correlated with increased brain levels of adiponectin, an adipocyte-secreted hormone. Using whole-brain c-Fos mapping, immunofluorescence staining of glutamatergic neurons using the marker CaMKII, and in vivo calcium imaging, we identified ACC glutamatergic neurons that were rapidly activated by single-bout physical exercise. Chemogenetic manipulation of these neurons modulated the rapid antidepressant effects of exercise. Genetic manipulations demonstrated that the global knockout of adiponectin or the selective deletion of its receptor, AdipoR1, in ACC-glutamatergic neurons abolished both neural activation and the rapid antidepressant response. Mechanistically, acute exercise upregulated adiponectin, activating AdipoR1 and promoting nuclear translocation of APPL1 in ACC-glutamatergic neurons. This molecular cascade enhanced the epigenetic regulation of synaptic protein expression and spinogenesis, culminating in a rapid antidepressant response. These findings not only elucidate a novel role for APPL1 nuclear translocation in mediating the antidepressant effects of acute exercise but also identify AdipoR1 as a potential therapeutic target for developing rapid-acting antidepressant interventions.

## Introduction

Major depressive disorder is a leading cause of disability worldwide, exerting profound social and economic burdens \[[^1]\]. Existing antidepressant treatments face several limitations, including high rates of treatment resistance, delayed onset of therapeutic effects, and adverse side effects \[[^2]\]. Consequently, there is an urgent need to develop safer and more effective rapid-acting antidepressant treatments. While chronic physical exercise is widely recognized as a low-cost, safe, and efficacious non-pharmaceutical treatment for depression \[[^3],[^4],[^5]\], the potential therapeutic effects of acute, single-bout exercise remain understudied. Emerging evidence indicates that a single bout of physical exercise can induce rapid mood improvements in individuals with depression \[[^6], [^7]\] and animal models \[[^8], [^9]\]. Despite these findings, the precise neurobiological mechanisms underlying these rapid antidepressant effects remain largely undefined.

The neural mechanisms underlying rapid antidepressant effects are increasingly linked to neuroplasticity changes in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) \[[^10]\]. These changes include transient increases in extracellular glutamate levels \[[^11]\], enhanced glutamatergic neurotransmission and spinogenesis \[[^12]\], and elevated firing rates of excitatory neurons \[[^13]\]. Notably, activation of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), a key subregion of the mPFC, has been identified as a biomarker for rapid antidepressant response \[[^14]\]. Clinical studies utilizing non-invasive neuroimaging have demonstrated that single-bout physical exercise can induce acute neuroplasticity changes in the cortex. Specifically, exercise has been shown to transiently increase glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) concentrations \[[^15]\] and shift local cortical circuits toward an excitatory state \[[^16], [^17]\]. Animal studies further support this view, indicating that treadmill running enhances the excitation-to-inhibition balance in cortical regions relative to sedentary conditions \[[^18]\]. However, the extent to which these acute cortical plasticity changes contribute to the rapid antidepressant effects of single-bout physical exercise remains largely uncharacterized. Elucidating the precise cellular and molecular pathways linking acute exercise to antidepressant efficacy is crucial for advancing non-pharmacological treatment strategies for mood disorders.

The antidepressant effects of continuous physical exercise could be mediated by exerkines secreted by peripheral organs, as certain exerkines can cross the blood-brain barrier and induce neuroplastic changes that regulate mood and cognitive function \[[^19], [^20]\]. Among these, adiponectin – a hormone secreted by adipocytes – is well established for its role in glucose metabolism energy homeostasis via interactions with adiponectin receptors 1 and 2 (AdipoR1 or AdipoR2) \[[^21],[^22],[^23],[^24]\]. More recent findings suggest that adiponectin plays a role in mood regulation \[[^25]\]. Notably, adiponectin’s downstream adaptor protein, APPL1 (adaptor protein containing pleckstrin homology domain, phosphotyrosine binding domain, and leucine zipper motif), directly interacts with AdipoRs \[[^26]\] and translocates into the nucleus \[[^27], [^28]\]. Nuclear APPL1 contributes to chromatin remodeling by preventing histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) from binding to chromatin, thereby alleviating transcriptional repression and promoting increased neural activity \[[^29]\]. Adiponectin receptors are primarily expressed in brain regions critical for mood regulation, including the mPFC \[[^30]\]. Remarkably, intracerebroventricular administration of recombinant adiponectin in mice has been shown to elicit rapid antidepressant responses within hours \[[^30]\], demonstrating its direct neuromodulatory effect. Furthermore, single-bout aerobic exercise has been found to rapidly increase serum adiponectin levels in physically active individuals, correlating with improved adaptive behavioral responses following exercise \[[^31]\]. These findings suggest that adiponectin-driven APPL1 nuclear translocation may play a key role in mediating the rapid antidepressant effects of acute physical exercise by initiating epigenetic regulation of cortical plasticity.

In this study, we identified ACC-glutamatergic neurons as a key neural substrate mediating the rapid antidepressant effects of single-bout exercise. Acute exercise elevates adiponectin levels, which in turn facilitates nuclear translocation of APPL1 in ACC-glutamatergic neurons via AdipoR1. Mechanistically, nuclear APPL1 enhances histone acetylation, thereby promoting synaptic protein expression and spinogenesis, which are critical for the observed rapid antidepressant response. These findings provide new insights into adipocyte-brain crosstalk, demonstrating how acute exercise induces epigenetic regulation of synaptic plasticity. Moreover, this finding highlights AdipoR1 as a promising target for the development of rapid-acting antidepressant interventions.

## Materials and methods

### Ethics approval and consent to participate

All methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations. For human experiments, ethical approval was obtained from the Human Subject Ethics Sub-committee (approval number: HSEARS20221111001). The clinical trial was registered at [https://www.clinicaltrials.gov](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/) with the unique identifier NCT06736067. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. For animal experiments, all experimental procedures were reviewed and approved by the institutional research ethics committee, and the researchers conducting the experiments were appropriately licensed. The study adhered to the ethical guidelines for animal research established by the Animal Subjects Ethics Sub-committee.

### Participants recruitment

The trial was designed as a single-arm pre-posttest study to evaluate the effects of 30 min of aerobic treadmill running on mood states. The primary outcome measured was depressed mood, assessed using the Profile of Mood States (POMS), while other affective domains evaluated by this scale were analyzed as secondary outcomes. Healthy participants were recruited via emails and posters displayed on campus. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. Potential participants completed an online questionnaire based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Inclusion criteria included university students or staff aged 18 to 40 years and self-reportedly healthy. Exclusion criteria were: 1) individuals with injuries impairing safe exercise, 2) individuals with metabolic, neurologic, or psychiatric disorders, or those with comorbid disorders, and 3) individuals currently taking antidepressant medication.

Eligible participants completed an online version of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) screen for depression and/or anxiety symptoms. Participants were classified as symptomatic (HADS > 7) or asymptomatic (HADS < = 7) based on their HADS scores for depression and/or anxiety and were allocated into two groups accordingly \[[^32]\]. Based on previous studies and power analyses considering an error probability of 5% and a study power of 0.80, we recruited 40 participants (16 males and 24 females) and divided them into two groups: symptom (anxiety and/or depression) and non-symptom groups (n = 20/group) \[[^33], [^34]\]. Participant characteristics are detailed in Table  [S1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03317-1#MOESM1). Experiments, including the mood evaluation questionnaire and treadmill exercise intervention, were conducted on the same day at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University in Hong Kong.

### Measurement of mood state in participants

We utilized the Profile of Mood States (POMS) to assess mood changes in participants before and after exercise. POMS is a 30-item questionnaire scored on a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from “Not at all” to “Extremely.” It provides seven subscales: 1) anger (e.g., grouchy, furious); 2) confusion (e.g., muddled, forgetful); 3) depression (e.g., sad, unworthy); 4) fatigue (e.g., tired, sluggish); 5) tension (e.g., nervous, anxious); 6) vigor (e.g., lively, active); and 7) esteem \[[^35]\]. The summary index, “Total Mood Disturbance (TMD),” was calculated by subtracting the total score of the two positive subscales (vigor and esteem) from the total score of the five negative subscales (anger, confusion, depression, fatigue, and tension) and then adding 100 points. A lower TMD score indicates a better mood state \[[^36]\].

### Single-bout treadmill training for human participants

For the 30-minute single-bout treadmill exercise intervention, the running protocol included a 5-minute warm-up, followed by a gradual increase in speed to reach an optimal intensity of 70–80% of the age-predicted maximum heart rate (MHR) \[[^37]\]. This intensity was maintained for 20 min, and the session concluded with a 5-minute cool-down. Participants wore a wireless heart rate monitor (Polar 10 series) throughout the exercise period, allowing the investigator to make speed adjustments as needed to ensure the session met the intensity criteria of the age-predicted MHR. The age-predicted MHR was calculated as 220 beats per minute (BPM) minus the participant’s age in years.

### Timeline for human study

All assessments and interventions were conducted individually with each participant on the same day, between 9:00 AM and 12:30 PM. Participants were advised to abstain from consuming alcoholic beverages the day before and to maintain their usual sleep and morning routines. Upon arrival for the testing session, participants received instructions on the exercise protocol from a physical educator, wore the heart rate monitor, and completed the Profile of Mood States (POMS) questionnaire immediately before the exercise session. For re-assessment of mood state using POMS after the exercise session, participants were allowed to rest in a seated position for five minutes before completing the POMS questionnaire a second time.

### Animal models and single-bout treadmill training

For the animal study, adult C57BL/6 J male mice (8–9 weeks old) were used for experiments and housed in the Centralized Animal Facility (CAF) at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. Adult C57 mice were used for behavioral assays, whole c-Fos mapping, in vivo calcium imaging, ELISA, immunofluorescence staining, and western blotting experiments. The CAF also maintained CaMKII-cre mice, APPL1 knockout (KO) mice, and Thy1-YFP mice. CaMKII-cre mice were used for chemogenetic manipulation, APPL1 mice were used for behavioral assays, and Thy1-YFP mice were used for the in vivo dendritic spine imaging. Adiponectin KO mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) and housed at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University Shenzhen Research Institute, which were used for the immunofluorescence staining and behavioral assays. All animals were group-housed under a 12-hour light-dark cycle (lights on 8:00–20:00 h) with ad libitum access to food and water. The exact number for each experiment was specified in relevant result or figure legend sections. The detailed protocols for each experiment are shown below.

To replicate the human study groups (with and without symptoms), we established two groups in our animal model: a home cage group (no stress) and a chronic unpredictable stress group (with stress) to evaluate the antidepressant effects of single-bout physical exercise. Mice in the no-stress group were kept in their cages for three weeks without exposure to stressors, while the stressed group underwent a three-week regimen of chronic unpredictable stressors (Table [S2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03317-1#MOESM1)) to induce depression-like behaviors.

The single-bout physical exercise protocol was implemented as previously described \[[^38],[^39],[^40]\]. Before the exercise intervention, mice underwent a three-day treadmill adaptation to minimize stress. On day 1, mice were acclimated to the testing room, handling, and treadmill. On day 2, mice were introduced to the treadmill’s incline (25°) for 5 min of adaptation. On day 3, mice experienced a warm-up stage with 5 min of treadmill running at a speed of 5 m/min on a 25° incline. On day 4, the formal 30-minute treadmill training commenced. Following a warm-up at a slow walking speed (5 m/min), mice ran in 30-second intervals with 60-second walking rest periods (5 m/min) between intervals. The exercise session began with speeds increasing gradually from 15 m/min to 20 m/min, then 25 m/min, and finally reaching 30 m/min. The session included 20 running repeats, each consisting of 30 s of running at 30 m/min followed by 1 min at 5 m/min. Speed acceleration to 30 m/min was achieved within 5 s, and deceleration to 5 m/min within 2 s. Both the warm-up and exercise sessions were conducted on a treadmill at 25°. To maintain running speed, mice were gently prodded by hand when they approached the end of the track. As a control, sedentary mice were placed on a stationary treadmill for the same duration in the same environment.

### Behavioral tests

Both treadmill adaptation and subsequent behavioral assessments were performed during the dark phase of the cycle to accommodate the nocturnal activity patterns of mice.

#### Open field test (OFT)

This test evaluates basic locomotor activity and anxiety-like behavior in mice. Each mouse was placed in the center of an open-field apparatus (dimensions: 44 × 44 × 30 cm) under dim lighting conditions (20–30 lux) in the testing room. The movements of the animals were tracked using an automatic monitoring system. The open field was cleaned with 70% ethanol between trials to ensure consistency. We use the first five minutes of recording data for analysis. Anxiety-like behavior was assessed by calculating the percentage of time spent in the center of the apparatus, while locomotor activity was measured by the total distance traveled. Data analysis was conducted using ANYMAZE software (Stoelting Co, Wood Dale, IL, USA).

#### Sucrose splash test (SST)

This test is commonly employed to assess anhedonia-like behavior, a core symptom of depression \[[^41]\]. A reduction in grooming behavior in mice is interpreted as a loss of self-care and diminished interest in pleasurable activities. In this test, a 10% sucrose solution is sprayed onto the mice’s fur. Due to the stickiness and rewarding nature of the sucrose, the mice are prompted to initiate grooming behavior. The time spent grooming their body, face, and paws was recorded over 5 minutes. The testing cages were cleaned with 70% alcohol between trials.

#### Tail suspension test (TST)

This test is commonly employed to assess learned helplessness behavior as another valid indicator for depression. Briefly, the mouse was suspended at the center of a rectangular compartment using tape, with a climb-stopper (plastic tube) positioned around its tail \[[^25]\]. The movements of the animals were recorded for 6 min using an automatic monitoring camera equipped with software. For data collection, immobility time—defined as the period during which all four limbs ceased struggling or only slight body movement occurred—was manually measured during the last 4 min by two experienced researchers. An increase in immobility time is indicative of heightened depression-like behavior.

#### Forced swim test (FST)

This test is commonly employed to assess learned helplessness behavior as another valid indicator for depression. Mice were placed in a Plexiglas cylinder (15 cm in diameter, 30 cm in height) filled with water maintained at 25–26 °C, with the water level reaching two-thirds of the cylinder’s height. The immobility of the mice was assessed during the last four minutes of a six-minute test. This evaluation was conducted in a sample-blinded manner by two independent observers using stopwatches. A mouse was considered immobile when it remained floating in the water, making only the minimal movements necessary to keep its head above the surface. An increase in immobility time is often interpreted as an indicator of heightened depression-like behavior.

### Brain tissue preparation

The animals were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane (Zoetis, Parsippany-Troy Hills, NJ, USA) and perfused with saline, followed by paraformaldehyde (PFA). The brain tissues were post-fixed in PFA overnight at 4 °C and subsequently immersed in 30% sucrose until they sank. Coronal brain sections (40 µm) were prepared using a vibratome (Leica Biosystems, Wetzlar, Germany). Consecutive 40-µm-thick coronal sections were sliced between 2.34 mm and −3.40 mm from bregma along the rostral-caudal axis. Each brain slice of every 0.7–0.8 mm was selected for immunostaining with antibodies against c-Fos, resulting in a total of nine brain slices per mouse.

### Immunofluorescence staining

Brain slices were washed with PBS and incubated with citric acid buffer (10 mM) for 10 min at 95 °C for antigen retrieval and then incubated with 2 N HCl for 10 min at 37 ◦C for denaturing double-strand DNA. After PBS washing, slices were incubated with primary antibodies (Table [S3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03317-1#MOESM1)) at 4 °C overnight, followed by a 2-hour incubation with the second antibody (Table  [S3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03317-1#MOESM1)) at room temperature. In the final step, sections were coverslipped with fluorescent mounting medium with DAPI (Fluoroshield™ with DAPI, Sigma).

### Brain-wide c-Fos mapping analysis

Z-stacks of brain slices stained with c-Fos were captured using a 10× objective on a Zeiss confocal microscope. Acquisition settings, including laser power, gain/offset, averaging, and dwell time, were kept constant across all samples. Before quantification, maximum intensity projections of each slice were generated. The intensity of c-Fos expression was calculated for all nine slices using a custom analysis software named “Brein,” developed and shared by Prof. Thomas Südhof’s group at Stanford University. We used “Brein” to quantify cFos-positive signals in anatomically defined brain regions, using the same region-based thresholding and quantification workflow as previously reported \[[^42]\].

The Brein software locates the positions of nine brain sections within its built-in brain atlas, accurately matching confocal images with the most suitable atlas images and aligning anatomical features of the corresponding brain regions. The “Calculate Intensities” function was employed to analyze the data and export fluorescence intensity measurements to an Excel spreadsheet for further analysis. The statistical results include relative fluorescence intensity values for each region in the brain sections. This experiment specifically focuses on the fluorescence expression of the c-Fos protein, with the level of c-Fos expression directly proportional to its fluorescence intensity, presented as relative fluorescence intensity in the target brain subregions.

### Stereotaxic injection of adeno-associated viruses

For adeno-associated virus (AAV) injection, mice were anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) and positioned in a stereotaxic apparatus (RWD, Shenzhen, China). Following local sterilization and an incision in the scalp, a high-speed microdrill was used to create bilateral injection holes in the skull. A glass micropipette, connected to an ultra-micro injection pump (Nanoliter2010, WPI, USA) and controlled by an injection controller (Micro4, WPI, USA), was employed for AAV delivery targeting the ACC with coordinates: anteroposterior (AP) 0.8 mm, mediolateral (ML) 0.3 mm, and subpial (SP) 0.6 mm \[[^43]\]. The micropipette was held in place for 5 min before retraction to ensure proper diffusion. Post-surgery, animals received Flunixin (2.5 mg/kg, subcutaneously) for three consecutive days and were allowed a 3-week recovery period. Detailed information on all viruses used is provided in Table  [S4](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03317-1#MOESM1).

### Clozapine N-oxide treatment

Clozapine N-oxide (CNO, Brand: APExBIO) was dissolved in saline and administered intraperitoneally at a dose of 1 mg/kg. This dosage was utilized for both chemogenetic activation (hM3Dq) and inhibition (hM4Di) experiments, as previously described \[[^44]\]. In the chemogenetic inhibition experiments, CNO was injected 30 min before treadmill running. For the chemogenetic activation experiments, CNO was administered 2 h before conducting the behavioral tests.

### In vivo transcranial two-photon imaging

To image neuronal activity in the ACC region, surgical procedures were performed as previously described \[[^43]\]. After a 3-week recovery period following AAV injection, which allowed for sufficient target gene expression in the infected neurons, the head skin was opened, and the skull over the ACC was carefully removed using a microdrill. The imaging window was then covered with a round glass coverslip. A customized metal scaffold was affixed to the mouse skull using dental cement. The awake mouse was secured on the imaging stage via the metal bar and allowed to acclimate for 30 min.

During the imaging session, we recorded the activity of ACC-glutamatergic neurons at various time points: pre-exercise, 30 min, 2 h, and 4 h post-exercise. The calcium activity of ACC-glutamatergic neurons, located at a depth of 200 to 300 µm, was recorded at a frequency of 2 Hz using a water-immersed objective on a Nikon A1 MP multiphoton microscope. During imaging, the laser was tuned to a wavelength of 920 nm. Imaging data were analyzed using ImageJ, following previously established protocols \[[^45]\]. All acquired time series images were corrected by the TurboReg module of ImageJ. The same neurons were circled as regions of interest (ROI) at each time point and analyzed in a sample-blind manner. The fluorescent value of each neuron was normalized as (F − F0)/F0, where the F0 (basal value) was the minimum of all values during each recording series. The average integrated calcium was calculated as the average of ΔF/F0 of all recording neurons.

### Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)

Blood samples were collected from the hearts of the mice and centrifuged to obtain serum. Serum adiponectin levels were measured using commercially available ELISA kits (ImmunoDiagnostics Limited, Cat. No. 32010). Serum samples were diluted 600-fold before performing the ELISA. Proteins were extracted from isolated mPFC and hippocampal tissues. Adiponectin levels in these brain regions were measured using commercially available ELISA kits specific to brain tissues (AdipoGen Life Sciences, AG-45A-0004Y).

### Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR)

Total RNA was extracted from brain cortical tissues at various time points post-exercise using the ReliaPrep™ RNA Tissue Miniprep System (Promega). The RNA was then reverse transcribed into cDNA using the GoScript™ Reverse Transcriptase Kit (Promega). Real-time PCR was performed with the CFX96 Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad) and the GoTaq® qPCR Master Mix (Promega). Primer sequences are provided in Table [S5](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03317-1#MOESM1). Relative mRNA expression levels were analyzed using the delta-delta Ct (ΔΔCt) method, with normalization to human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) as the internal control.

### Acquisition and analysis of image APPL1 nuclear translocation

Brain slices were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies against APPL1 and CaMKII (a widely used marker for glutamatergic neurons) \[[^46]\], followed by a 2-hour incubation with secondary antibodies at room temperature (see Table  [S3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03317-1#MOESM1) for details). Subsequently, sections were mounted with a fluorescent mounting medium containing DAPI to label the nuclei (Fluoroshield™ with DAPI, Sigma). Images were captured using a Zeiss confocal microscope at 60x magnification.

To assess the nuclear translocation of APPL1 in neurons, we selected neurons that were double labeled with CaMKII and DAPI staining for analysis. The Region of Interest (ROI) function in ImageJ was employed to delineate the cell contour (using Alexa 568 for CaMKII) and the nucleus (using DAPI staining). These contours were then applied to the APPL1 images (using Alexa 488 for APPL1) to determine the distribution of fluorescence intensity of APPL1 within glutamatergic neurons. All analyses were conducted by two well-trained researchers in a sample-blind manner to ensure objectivity and accuracy.

### Preparation of nuclear protein extracts

Cytosolic and nuclear fractions of proteins were prepared using the Minute™ Cytosolic and Nuclear Extraction Kit for Frozen/Fresh Tissues (Cat. No. NT-032). Following exercise, mice were sacrificed, and brain tissues were collected. The tissues were ground with a pestle for approximately 1 min (40–60 strokes). The resulting homogenate was processed to separate cytosolic and nuclear proteins according to the kit’s protocol. Nuclear proteins were subsequently used to assess histone protein acetylation.

### Synaptoneurosome and total protein preparations

To extract synaptoneurosome fractions, the mPFC was isolated, homogenized, and purified using the ice-cold Syn-PER Synaptic Protein Extraction Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The homogenates were centrifuged at 1200×g for 10 min at 4 °C to collect the cytosolic fraction, which was then centrifuged at 15,000× g for 30 min at 4 °C. The synaptosomal fraction was resuspended in Syn-PER reagent and used for synaptic protein quantification via western blotting. For total protein extraction, mPFC tissues were homogenized in ice-cold radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) containing Halt™ phosphatase/protease inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Samples were centrifuged at 14,000×g for 30 min at 4 °C.

Protein concentrations of synaptoneurosome and homogenates were quantified using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA).

### Western blotting

A total of 30 µg of protein from each sample was loaded and separated using SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by transfer to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). The membranes were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) for 1 h and then incubated overnight with primary antibodies (see Table [S3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03317-1#MOESM1) for details). After washing, the membranes were incubated with HRP-linked secondary antibodies (Table  [S3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03317-1#MOESM1)) for 1 h at room temperature. Protein bands were visualized using an imaging system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, USA) and analyzed with ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, USA).

For quantification in western blotting, total protein and nuclear protein extracts were used to measure total histone H4 and acetylated H4, respectively. Tubulin and histone H3 served as internal controls for total and nuclear extracts, respectively. Synaptoneurosomes were utilized to assess synaptic protein expression, with tubulin or actin as internal control.

### Cannula implantation and drug infusion

For cannula implantation, male mice aged 6 to 7 weeks were deeply anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) and secured on a stereotaxic frame (RWD Life Science). Guide cannulas (RWD Life Science) were bilaterally implanted into the ACC with coordinates anteroposterior +0.8 mm, mediolateral ±0.4 mm, and dorsoventral −0.9 mm from the bregma. The cannulas were affixed to the skull using dental cement and three skull screws. Metal cannula caps (RWD Life Science) were applied to prevent damage from gnawing. Following implantation, mice were allowed a 2-week recovery period and were pre-handled by the researcher one week before the exercise intervention to minimize stress.

As previously described, importazole was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to achieve a final concentration of 40 μM and administered at 0.3 μl per side for the cannula infusion and local drug infusion experiments \[[^47]\]. The peptides Tat-APPLNLS (YGRKKRRQRRRRRASEKQKEIERVKEK) and TatAPPL1Scr (YGRKKRRQRRRRRASEKQKEIEAAAAA) were synthesized by Genscript (Shanghai, China), dissolved in artificial cerebrospinal fluid to a final concentration of 10 μg/μl, and locally injected at 0.2 μl per side via bilateral cannulas \[[^47]\].

For the cannula drug infusion, mice were lightly anesthetized with isoflurane in a glass chamber for 10–15 s. The metal cap was removed from the guide cannula, and injection cannulas (RWD Life Science) were inserted. Importazole was bilaterally infused into the ACC using microinjection at a flow rate of 0.1 μl per minute. Following the infusion, the injection cannula was left in place for 5 min to facilitate solution diffusion. Mice were lightly anesthetized again with isoflurane to remove the injection cannula and secure the cap. After a 10-min rest period, the mice returned to a normal awake state and subsequently underwent treadmill intervention.

### Dendritic spine imaging

To image the ACC region, we employed a surgical procedure like previously described but with minor adjustment \[[^48]\]. Before the imaging experiments, Thy1-YFP male mice underwent surgery to create a glass window analogous to a calcium imaging window. We utilized a Nikon A1 MP multiphoton microscope (Nikon, Japan) with a laser excitation wavelength of 920 nm to visualize dendritic spines. During imaging sessions, mice were head-fixed and kept awake to ensure stability and accuracy.

To accurately target the ACC region, imaging was conducted within 0–400 μm of the midline, demarcated by the sagittal sinus, and consistent imaging parameters were maintained across different time points. Each Thy1-YFP mouse was imaged in the same field of view by referencing the same blood vessel for precise localization. For the importazole infusion experiment, Thy1-YFP mice were imaged at a 2-hour time point to assess changes.

The dendritic spine analysis was conducted in accordance with the methods outlined in prior studies \[[^45], [^49]\]. To assess spine formation and elimination rates, the same dendritic segments were examined at various time points, using the initial spine count from the first imaging session as a reference. Spines were classified as stable if visible in both views, as eliminated if seen in the first view but absent in the second, and as newly formed if only appearing in the second view. The rates of spine elimination and formation were determined by dividing the number of spines eliminated or formed in the second view by the total number of spines in the first view. For each mouse, 80–100 spines were counted.

### Statistical analysis

For the animal experiment, no formal statistical methods were used to estimate sample size. The number of animals per group was chosen based on previous studies and ethical guidelines that comply with the 3 R rules. Mice/samples used in our experiment were randomly assigned to each conditioning treatment. No data were excluded from analysis. The investigator was not blind to group allocation due to the requirement for intervention during the experiment, but was double-blinded to the outcome assessment. In the clinical study, neither the participants nor the experimenter was blind to the conditions of the study due to the characteristics of the intervention (i.e., physical exercise). All figures have been provided with the description of statistical tests of appropriate justification, and estimates of variation within each group (mean ± standard deviation) in the corresponding figure legend.

Figures and data analyses were conducted using GraphPad Prism 9 (GraphPad Software, USA). Data normality was assessed using the Shapiro–Wilk test for sample sizes less than 8, or the D’Agostino and Pearson test for sample sizes of 8 or more. Clinical data were analyzed using two-way RM ANOVA followed by Bonferroni’s multiple comparisons test. In pre-clinical data involving two independent variables, a two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post hoc test for multiple comparisons was applied. For comparisons between two individual groups with normally distributed data, an unpaired t-test was used. For non-parametric data, the Mann-Whitney test was employed. When comparing more than two groups with a single variable, a one-way ANOVA was performed, followed by Dunn’s multiple comparison test for comparisons with the baseline, or Tukey’s multiple comparison test for comparisons between groups. Data were presented as mean ± SEM. Statistical significance was denoted as follows: \*P < 0.05, \*\*P < 0.01, \*\*\*P < 0.001, \*\*\*\*P < 0.0001.

## Results

### Single-bout physical exercise elicits rapid antidepressant effects

To establish a mouse model displaying the rapid antidepressant effect with single-bout exercise protocol, we initially recruited participants **(refer to** Table  [S1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03317-1#MOESM1) **for clinical characteristics)** to investigate the immediate impact of single-bout treadmill exercise on improving mood states (Fig. [1A](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03317-1#Fig1)). We used the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) to pre-screen the presence and severity of depression or anxiety symptoms of all participants. Participants with a score of 7 or less were categorized as having no symptoms (no symptom group). In contrast, those with a score greater than 7 were classified as having symptoms (symptom group) (Fig. [1A](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03317-1#Fig1)). After being subjected to a single bout of 30-minute treadmill running, mood states were measured immediately post-exercise. Analysis using the Profile of Mood States (POMS) questionnaire (Fig. [1B](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03317-1#Fig1)) indicated that single-bout exercise significantly reduced total mood disturbance (TMD) (Fig. [1C](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03317-1#Fig1)) and enhanced vigor and esteem (Fig. [1D](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03317-1#Fig1)) across all participants. Furthermore, single-bout exercise diminished negative mood across five subscales—anxiety, fatigue, depression, confusion, and anger—in participants exhibiting depressive symptoms (Fig. [1E](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03317-1#Fig1)). The data confirmed the rapid mood-elevating effects of a single-bout treadmill exercise as previously reported \[[^33]\]. We subsequently established a mouse model with treadmill running to study detailed mechanisms underlying this rapid antidepressant response.

Fig. 1: Single-bout physical exercise elicits rapid antidepressant effects in humans and mice.

We adopted a mouse model with a 30-minute treadmill running in mice with or without stress (Fig. [1F](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03317-1#Fig1)). Single-bout exercise did not alter locomotor activity or anxiety-like behavior in all mice 30 min post-exercise (Fig. [1G](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03317-1#Fig1)). Yet, it significantly alleviated depression-like behavior in the forced swim test (FST) in stressed mice (Fig. [1H](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03317-1#Fig1)). Additionally, single-bout exercise induced a marked rapid antidepressant response in both non-stressed and stressed mice 2 h post-exercise, as evidenced by a significant increase in grooming time in the sucrose splash test (SST) (Fig. [1I](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03317-1#Fig1)). This rapid antidepressant effect persisted up to 24-hour post-exercise, as demonstrated by reduced immobility time in the tail suspension test (TST) (Fig. [1I](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03317-1#Fig1)), though no significant differences were observed in the FST at the 48-hour timepoint (Fig. [1I](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03317-1#Fig1)). These findings illustrate that single-bout exercise triggers rapid antidepressant effects lasting up to 24 h in mice. Collectively, our studies indicated the rapid antidepressant effects of single-bout physical exercise.

### ACC serves as the potential brain region mediating the rapid antidepressant effect of single-bout exercise

To elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying the rapid antidepressant effects of single-bout physical exercise, we conducted a comprehensive whole-brain mapping of the immediate early gene c-Fos expression (Fig. [2A](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03317-1#Fig2)) to identify key regions for a mechanistic study. We assessed the relative c-Fos immunofluorescence intensity across 146 brain regions within eight major brain structures after exercise in non-stressed mice (Fig. [S1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03317-1#MOESM1)). Our analysis revealed significant alterations in c-Fos expression in 17 brain regions (Fig. [2B](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03317-1#Fig2)). Notably, changes were observed in the fasciola cinerea (Fc) of the hippocampus; the nucleus of Darkschewitsch (Dk), the superior colliculus (SuG), and the Edinger-Westphal nucleus (EW) in the brainstem; the organum vasculosum laminae terminalis (VOLT), the lateral hypothalamic area (LH), and the hypothalamus (HYP) in the hypothalamus; the secondary motor area (M2), the prelimbic area (Prl), the ACC, and the gustatory areas (Gus) in the cortex; the striatum-like amygdala nuclei (Astr), the central amygdala nucleus (CeC), the caudoputamen (CP), and the anterior amygdala area (AA) in the striatum/pallidum systems; and the anterodorsal nucleus (AD) and the intermediodorsal nucleus (IMD) in the thalamus. In contrast, no significant changes were detected in the olfactory bulb or cortical subplate.

![figure 2](https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41380-025-03317-1/MediaObjects/41380_2025_3317_Fig2_HTML.png?as=webp)

Fig. 2: Single-bout physical exercise activates the ACC-glutamatergic neurons to elicit antidepressant effects.

Notably, the ACC, a critical subregion of the mPFC, is involved in the pathogenesis of depression and the therapeutic response to rapid antidepressants in both human \[[^14], [^50], [^51]\] and animal studies \[[^52], [^53]\]. Our study identified the ACC as one of the regions exhibiting a significant increase in c-Fos immunofluorescence intensity after exercise. To further investigate whether acute exercise can elevate ACC activity under stress conditions, we quantified the number of c-Fos positive cells in the ACC across four groups. Our results showed that stress significantly reduced c-Fos expression in the ACC of sedentary mice compared to non-stressed counterparts (Fig. [2C and D](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03317-1#Fig2)). Notably, acute exercise increased c-Fos expression in both non-stressed and stressed mice (Fig. [2C and D](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03317-1#Fig2)). These results suggest that acute exercise enhances ACC activity in physiological and stressful conditions, indicating that ACC is the potential brain region mediating the rapid antidepressant effect of single-bout exercise.

### Single-bout physical exercise activates ACC-glutamatergic neurons to elicit rapid antidepressant effects

To identify the neuronal types contributing to the increased c-Fos expression in the ACC of exercised mice, we conducted double immunofluorescence staining to examine the co-expression of c-Fos with Ca <sup>2+/</sup> calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) in brain slices from both sedentary and exercise groups. Notably, CaMKII is widely used as a marker for glutamatergic neurons in forebrain \[[^46]\]. Our analysis revealed a significantly higher percentage of activated CaMKII <sup>+</sup> neurons in the ACC of exercised mice (Fig. [2D](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03317-1#Fig2)). This finding was further corroborated by a reduction in c-Fos <sup>+</sup> /GAD67 <sup>+</sup> and c-Fos <sup>+</sup> /GABA <sup>+</sup> neurons in the exercise group compared to sedentary mice (Fig. [S2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03317-1#MOESM1)). These results suggest that the observed increase in c-Fos expression is primarily due to the activation of glutamatergic neurons in the ACC following single-bout exercise. We further confirmed the activation of ACC-glutamatergic neurons induced by single-bout exercise using in vivo calcium imaging (Fig. [2E](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03317-1#Fig2)). Single-bout exercise significantly increased calcium activity in ACC-glutamatergic neurons at both 30 min and 2 h after exercise, with the activity returning to baseline levels 4 h after exercise (Fig. [2F](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03317-1#Fig2)). Notably, sedentary mice did not show any significant changes in calcium activity across all time points (Fig. [S3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03317-1#MOESM1)). Together, both immunostaining and in vivo calcium imaging demonstrated the rapid activation of ACC-glutamatergic neurons in response to single-bout exercise.

To investigate whether the activation of ACC-glutamatergic neurons was necessary for the rapid antidepressant response following exercise, we employed a chemogenetic approach to inhibit the activity of these neurons before exercise (Fig. [2G](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03317-1#Fig2)). We administered CNO into CaMKII-Cre mice injected with the DIO-hM4Di-DREADD virus in the ACC (Fig. [2G](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03317-1#Fig2)). The virus injection site in the ACC was confirmed (Fig. [S4A](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03317-1#MOESM1)). Immunostaining of c-Fos demonstrated the efficacy of chemogenetically inhibiting exercise-induced neuronal activation in the ACC (Fig. [S5A-C](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03317-1#MOESM1)). Furthermore, the chemogenetic inhibition of ACC-glutamatergic neurons blocked the exercise-induced increase in grooming behavior in the SST at 2 h, and blocked the decreased immobility time in the TST at 24 h compared to saline-treated exercised controls. This inhibition effect persisted at the 48-hour time point in the FST (Fig. [2H](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03317-1#Fig2)). These results demonstrate that the activation of ACC-glutamatergic neurons is required for single-bout exercise to elicit a rapid antidepressant effect.

To further confirm the role of ACC-glutamatergic neurons in rapid antidepressant action, we tested whether chemogenetic activation of these neurons could mimic the rapid antidepressant response induced by single-bout exercise (Fig. [2I](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03317-1#Fig2)). The c-Fos immunofluorescence staining validated the efficacy of chemogenetic activation (Fig. [S5D-F](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03317-1#MOESM1)). Behavioral tests revealed that chemogenetic activation of ACC-glutamatergic neurons increased grooming behaviors in the SST at 2 h and reduced immobility time in the TST at 24 h and FST at 48 h, compared to mice treated with saline (Fig. [2J](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03317-1#Fig2)). Collectively, these chemogenetic studies support the critical role of ACC-glutamatergic neuron activation in the rapid antidepressant effects elicited by single-bout exercise.

### Increased adiponectin levels correlate with the rapid antidepressant effect of single-bout exercise

Having identified the ACC-glutamatergic neurons as the specific brain region and cellular target mediating the antidepressant effects of single-bout physical exercise, we further investigated the mechanism by which exercise activates these neurons. We measured adiponectin levels in both serum and brain tissue of mice 30 min post-exercise (Fig. [3A](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03317-1#Fig3)). Further, in sedentary mice, stress reduced adiponectin levels in both serum and mPFC compared to non-stress controls (Fig. [3B and C](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03317-1#Fig3)). Our results showed that exercise elevated serum adiponectin levels in stressed mice (Fig. [3B](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03317-1#Fig3)) and increased mPFC adiponectin levels in both non-stressed and stressed mice (Fig. [3C](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03317-1#Fig3)). Notably, we observed a significant negative correlation between adiponectin concentrations in the mPFC and immobility times in the FST 30 min post-exercise (Fig. [3D](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03317-1#Fig3)), but not in the hippocampus (Fig. [S6](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03317-1#MOESM1)). These findings suggest that the rapid antidepressant effect of single-bout exercise may be mediated by increased adiponectin levels in the mPFC rather than the hippocampus.

![figure 3](https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41380-025-03317-1/MediaObjects/41380_2025_3317_Fig3_HTML.png?as=webp)

Fig. 3: Adiponectin-AdipoR1 signaling is required for single-bout physical exercise to induce ACC-glutamatergic neuronal activation and rapid antidepressant effects.

### Adiponectin-AdipoR1 signaling in ACC-glutamatergic neurons is involved in the rapid antidepressant effects of exercise

Previous studies have shown that the mPFC exhibits a higher expression of AdipoR1 compared to AdipoR2 \[[^30]\]. To determine whether AdipoR1 is expressed in the ACC-glutamatergic neurons and its colabeling with CaMKII <sup>+</sup> neurons, we performed immunostaining to co-localize AdipoR1 and the glutamatergic neuron marker CaMKII. We observed significant co-localization (Fig. [3E](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03317-1#Fig3)). Notably, AdipoR1-expressing CaMKII <sup>+</sup> neurons accounted for as much as 83.3% of all CaMKII <sup>+</sup> neurons in the ACC (Fig. [3F](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03317-1#Fig3)). Collectively, these results indicate that most glutamatergic neurons in the ACC express the AdipoR1 receptor, establishing a neuroanatomical basis for adiponectin’s direct influence on ACC-glutamatergic neurons.

Given the essential role of ACC-glutamatergic neuron activation in mediating the rapid antidepressant effects of single-bout physical exercise, we investigated whether disrupting adiponectin-AdipoR1 signaling would affect this neuronal activation. We first assessed the activation state of ACC-glutamatergic neurons in *Adipo* <sup><i>-/-</i></sup> mice 2 h post-exercise (Fig. [3F](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03317-1#Fig3)) and observed a significant reduction in their activation (Fig. [3G, H](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03317-1#Fig3)). Additionally, we specifically knocked down AdipoR1 in ACC-glutamatergic neurons (Fig. [3I](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03317-1#Fig3)) and confirmed the efficacy of the viral knockdown using qPCR (Fig. [S7](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03317-1#MOESM1)). This knockdown reduced neuronal activation 2 h post-exercise (Fig. [3J, K](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03317-1#Fig3)). Finally, we examined whether AdipoR1 knockdown in ACC-glutamatergic neurons affected the rapid antidepressant response induced by single-bout exercise (Fig. [3I](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03317-1#Fig3)). The knockdown effectively abolished the exercise-induced increase in grooming time in the SST at 2 h and the decrease in immobility time in the TST at 24 h (Fig. [3L](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03317-1#Fig3)), indicating that disruption of adiponectin-AdipoR1 signaling prevents the antidepressant response triggered by single-bout exercise.

### APPL1 in ACC-glutamatergic neurons is required for the rapid antidepressant effects of exercise

Adiponectin receptors initiate the downstream signaling cascades through interactions with the adaptor protein APPL1 \[[^26]\]. In neurons, APPL1 plays a role in regulating structural plasticity \[[^54]\] and histone modifications associated with synaptic gene transcription \[[^29]\]. To investigate whether APPL1 is necessary for single-bout exercise to elicit rapid antidepressant effects, we utilized global *Appl1* <sup><i>-/-</i></sup> mice (Fig. [S8A, B](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03317-1#MOESM1)). The APPL1 deficiency did not affect basal grooming time or immobility time in sedentary mice (Fig. [S8C](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03317-1#MOESM1)). However, the absence of APPL1 blocked the effects of single-bout exercise, as evidenced by a decrease in grooming time in the SST at 2 h and an increase in immobility time in the TST at 24 h (Fig. [S8C](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03317-1#MOESM1)), suggesting a potential role for APPL1 in mediating the rapid antidepressant effects of single-bout exercise.

We next performed a conditional knockdown of APPL1 in ACC-glutamatergic neurons (Fig. [4A, B](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03317-1#Fig4)). We confirmed a significant reduction in APPL1 protein expression by Western blotting (Fig. [4B](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03317-1#Fig4)) and observed decreased immunofluorescence intensity in CaMKII <sup>+</sup> neurons (Fig. [S9](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03317-1#MOESM1)), indicating efficient and cell-type-specific AAV-mediated APPL1 knockdown in the target neurons. Behavioral analyses showed that specific knockdown of APPL1 in these neurons attenuated the rapid antidepressant effect of single-bout exercise in mice. At the same time, it did not affect baseline depressive-like behaviors in sedentary mice (Fig. [4C](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03317-1#Fig4)). Furthermore, we re-introduced APPL1 into the ACC-glutamatergic neurons of *Appl1* <sup><i>-/-</i></sup> mice (Fig. [4D, E](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03317-1#Fig4)). Re-introducing APPL1 restored the rapid antidepressant effects of single-bout exercise in *Appl1* <sup><i>-/-</i></sup> mice (Fig. [4F](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03317-1#Fig4)). These findings suggest that APPL1 expression in ACC-glutamatergic neurons is crucial for mediating the rapid antidepressant effects of single-bout exercise.

![figure 4](https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41380-025-03317-1/MediaObjects/41380_2025_3317_Fig4_HTML.png?as=webp)

Fig. 4: Adaptor protein APPL1 in ACC-glutamatergic neurons is essential for the rapid antidepressant effects of single-bout physical exercise, and its nuclear translocation depends on the adiponectin-AdipoR1 signaling.

### APPL1 nuclear translocation depends on adiponectin-AdipoR1 signaling in glutamatergic neurons

After confirming the involvement of APPL1, we further explored how this adaptor protein mediates adiponectin signaling to produce antidepressant effects following single-bout exercise. Previous studies have demonstrated that APPL1 can translocate to the nucleus in response to adiponectin stimulation via AdipoR1 in cultured cells \[[^27], [^28]\]. We speculated that single-bout exercise increases adiponectin to trigger APPL1 nuclear translocation in the ACC glutamatergic neurons. To test this hypothesis, we first examined the temporal changes in APPL1 mRNA expression levels and the nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratio following exercise (Fig. [4G](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03317-1#Fig4)). Our results showed that exercise did not affect APPL1 mRNA levels at any time point (Fig. [4H](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03317-1#Fig4)). However, immunostaining analysis of the nuclear and cytoplasmic APPL1 expression revealed that APPL1 underwent rapid and sustained nuclear translocation in ACC glutamatergic neurons, peaking at 2 h post-exercise and returning to baseline levels 24 h later (Fig. [4I, J](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03317-1#Fig4)). This indicates that APPL1 undergoes a time-dependent nuclear translocation in ACC-glutamatergic neurons in response to single-bout exercise, without changes in total expression levels.

To investigate whether adiponectin-AdipoR1 signalling is critical in mediating the single-bout exercise-induced APPL1 nuclear translocation, we examined the APPL1 nuclear translocation after exercise using *Adipo* <sup><i>-/-</i></sup> mice (Fig. [4K](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03317-1#Fig4)). Results showed that adiponectin deficiency abolished the increase in APPL1 nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio 2 h (the peak timepoint for APPL1 nucleus translocation by single-bout exercise) post-exercise (Fig. [4L, M](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03317-1#Fig4)). A similar effect was also observed in mice with specific AdipoR1 knockdown in ACC-glutamatergic neurons (Fig. [4N, O](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03317-1#Fig4)). Collectively, these results suggest that APPL1 nuclear translocation in ACC-glutamatergic neurons following single-bout exercise is dependent on adiponectin-AdipoR1 signaling.

### APPL1 nuclear translocation increases histone acetylation and synaptic protein expression

Previous studies conducted on cultured hippocampal neurons have demonstrated that nuclear accumulation of APPL1 increases histone H4 acetylation. This occurs through the disruption of HDAC2 binding to the cyclic AMP response element-binding (CREB) promoter within chromatin \[[^29]\]. The transcription factor CREB is known to facilitate the transcription of several synaptic genes, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf), c-fos, and candidate plasticity gene 15 (cpg15) \[[^55]\]. Based on these findings, we proposed the role of nuclear APPL1 on epigenetic regulation on synaptic gene expression (Fig. [5A](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03317-1#Fig5)). Consistent with in vitro findings that nuclear APPL1 significantly increased acetylation at the H4K5 and H4K12 sites in cultured hippocampal neurons \[[^29]\], our study found a significant increase in histone H4 acetylation at the H4K12 site 2 h post-exercise (Fig. [5B, C](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03317-1#Fig5)), coinciding with a peak in APPL1 nuclear translocation in ACC-glutamatergic neurons (Fig. [4J](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03317-1#Fig4)). The level of histone H4 acetylation returned to baseline 24 h post-exercise (Fig. [5B, C](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03317-1#Fig5)). These results suggest that single-bout exercise induces temporal changes in H4 acetylation.

![figure 5](https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41380-025-03317-1/MediaObjects/41380_2025_3317_Fig5_HTML.png?as=webp)

Fig. 5: Nuclear translocation of APPL1 in the ACC is required for epigenetic regulation on spinogenesis underlying the rapid antidepressant effect of single-bout physical exercise.

The CREB-targeted genes (bdnf, c-fos, and cpg15) play a crucial role in promoting presynaptic axonal elaboration, dendritic outgrowth, and alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor insertion \[[^55]\]. Notably, single-bout exercise led to the increased synaptic protein expression in the synaptoneurosome of mPFC 2 h post-exercise, including the AMPA receptor subunit - glutamate receptor 1 (GluR1), postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95), synapsin1, and synaptophysin. A significant increase in GluR1 and PSD95 protein expression was also observed 24 h post-exercise, although all synaptic protein levels returned to baseline by 48 h post-exercise (Fig. [5D](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03317-1#Fig5)). Based on the proposed theoretical model and our research findings, we speculated that rapid and sustained nuclear translocation of APPL1 in ACC-glutamatergic neurons after exercise would initiate molecular signaling cascades, resulting in temporal changes in histone acetylation and synaptic protein expression.

### Pharmacological inhibition of APPL1 translocation abolishes the effects of exercise

A rapid increase in synaptic protein expression or spine formation is recognized as a neural basis for rapid antidepressant action \[[^12], [^56]\]. Thus, we further investigated whether the rapid antidepressant effect of single-bout physical exercise is associated with spinogenesis and whether it was dependent on APPL1 nuclear translocation. We performed pharmacological blockade of APPL1 nuclear translocation by intracerebral infusion of the nuclear transport inhibitor importazole into the ACC (Fig. [5E](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03317-1#Fig5)). Importazole was administered 10 min before single-bout exercise (Fig. [S9A](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03317-1#MOESM1)). Our results showed that importazole significantly inhibited the APPL1 nuclear translocation for at least 2 h after single-bout exercise (Fig. [S9B, C](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03317-1#MOESM1)) and abolished the exercise-induced increase in histone H4 acetylation 2 h post-exercise (Fig. [5F, G](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03317-1#Fig5)). Furthermore, we detected the in vivo spine formation and elimination in ACC glutamatergic neurons in Thy1-YFP mice (Fig. [5H](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03317-1#Fig5)) and found that local infusion of the importazole abolished the single-bout exercise-induced spine formation 2 h post-exercise (Fig. [5I, J](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03317-1#Fig5)). Consistently, blocking APPL1 nuclear translocation significantly diminished the rapid antidepressant effects of single-bout exercise, as evidenced by a decrease in grooming time in the SST at 2 h and an increase in immobility time in the TST at 24 h (Fig. [5K, L](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03317-1#Fig5)). In addition, we utilized the TAT-APPL1 <sub>NLS</sub> peptide to specifically block APPL1 nuclear translocation by disrupting its interaction with Importin-α (Fig. [S10D](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03317-1#MOESM1)). Using a similar cannula administration method, we injected the TAT-APPL1 <sub>NLS</sub> (scramble peptide TAT-APPL1 <sub>Scr</sub> as control) into the ACC of WT mice. Our results showed that TAT-APPL1 <sub>NLS</sub> significantly inhibited the APPL1 nuclear translocation at the 2-hour timepoint after single-bout exercise (Fig. [S10E, F](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03317-1#MOESM1)) and attenuated the rapid antidepressant effects of single-bout exercise, as evidenced by a decrease in grooming time in the SST at 2 h and an increase in immobility time in the TST at 24 h (Fig. [5M](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03317-1#Fig5)). Collectively, these findings underscore the critical role of APPL1 nuclear translocation in promoting histone acetylation and spinogenesis in the ACC-glutamatergic neurons, which are linked to the rapid antidepressant response induced by single-bout exercise.

## Discussion

Our study uncovers the involvement of adiponectin signaling in the neural mechanism underlying the rapid antidepressant effects of single-bout physical exercise, highlights the role of adipocyte-brain crosstalk. In detail, the metabolic hormone adiponectin, secreted by adipocytes, binds to AdipoR1 on ACC glutamatergic neurons, promoting the nuclear translocation of the adaptor protein APPL1. This induces synaptic protein expression and spinogenesis through chromatin remodeling-related histone acetylation (Fig. [6](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03317-1#Fig6)). Our findings reveal adiponectin’s novel role in mediating the rapid antidepressant responses of physical exercise, paving the way for the development of new rapid antidepressant therapies based on this adipocyte-brain crosstalk. Additionally, our study underscores the potential of single-bout exercise interventions as an effective strategy for the rapid alleviation of depressive symptoms.

Fig. 6: Summary of the mechanism underlying the rapid antidepressant effects of single-bout physical exercise.

Although recent studies have explored the affective response to single-bout physical exercise, results are mixed based on varied exercise protocols (in terms of modality, intensity, and duration) and participant health status \[[^6]\]. However, most studies indicate that single-bout physical exercise more or less improves positive mood states and decreases anxiety and depression symptoms via various modalities \[[^57]\] and intensities \[[^58]\]. Here, we demonstrate that 30 min of aerobic treadmill exercise significantly enhances mood states in participants, irrespective of the presence of depressive symptoms, as well as in mice. Our results add to the growing body of evidence supporting single-bout exercise as a rapid and accessible strategy for improving mood. In parallel, our animal study demonstrates that exercise rapidly alleviates depressive symptoms within 2 h, with effects lasting up to 24 h in both stressed and non-stressed mice. This rapid and sustained impact is corroborated by a rat study, which showed reduced immobility in the FST the day following treadmill training \[[^9]\]. These valid behavioral findings provide a foundation for investigating the neural mechanisms underlying such rapid antidepressant effects. However, as our study examined the rapid antidepressant response only in male mice, it remains unclear whether female mice share the same underlying mechanisms. Future studies should investigate the effects of sex on the rapid antidepressant effect of acute exercise, as females may exhibit a different response compared to males \[[^59]\].

Whole-brain c-Fos mapping data from rapid-acting antidepressants such as ketamine and psilocybin reveal enhanced c-Fos expression in the ACC \[[^60]\]. Our findings demonstrate that the ACC also exhibits high c-Fos expression following single-bout exercise. In addition, the correlation between adiponectin levels in the mPFC and rapid antidepressant response in our study, as well as the highly expressed adiponectin receptors in the prefrontal area \[[^30]\], further support the central role of the ACC (the subregion of mPFC) in mediating rapid antidepressant behavior of exercise. Lastly, both human \[[^50]\] and animal studies \[[^61]\] have implicated the key role of the ACC in depression neuropathology and mediating the rapid antidepressant responses. From the cellular level, our chemogenetic experiments indicate that activating ACC-glutamatergic neurons is crucial for the rapid antidepressant effects induced by exercise, providing novel insights into the linkage between exercise-enhanced cortical glutamatergic neuronal activity in ACC and the antidepressant response. Based on the above three reasons, we confirmed the activation of ACC glutamatergic neurons as a key neural substrate in mediating the rapid antidepressant effects of physical exercise. The exclusive focus on the ACC represents a limitation of our study, given that the observation that other brain regions with significant c-fos changes, such as the prelimbic cortex \[[^62]\], amygdala-related regions \[[^63], [^64]\], and fasciola cinerea in the hippocampus \[[^65]\] may also be involved in rapid antidepressant response. Future investigations are warranted to systematically examine the roles of these additional brain areas and their potential interactions with the ACC in mediating the antidepressant effects of acute exercise. Such studies will help provide a more comprehensive understanding of the neural circuits underlying exercise-induced antidepressant responses. Furthermore, the chemogenetic manipulation of the ACC-glutamatergic can partially mimic the antidepressant effect of exercise, with this effect persisted up to 48 h post-CNO injection. In contrast, the antidepressant effect of a single-bout physical exercise lasts only up to 24 h. This discrepancy is likely due to the prolonged neuronal activation induced by CNO/DREADD-mediated chemogenetic manipulation \[[^66]\], rather than reflecting the natural effects of acute exercise. Although our study highlights the role of glutamatergic neurons in the antidepressant effects of physical exercise, we cannot exclude the involvement of other neurotransmitters such as GABA, dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin. These neurotransmitters are also modulated by exercise and may contribute to exercise-induced antidepressant effects \[[^67],[^68],[^69]\]. Further research is needed to investigate other neurotransmission systems that could contribute to the antidepressant effects of physical exercise.

Engaging in physical exercise triggers the release of a variety of exerkines from peripheral organs \[[^19]\]. Some of these exerkines can cross the blood-brain barrier and lead to neuroplasticity changes in areas that are linked to mood regulation and the antidepressant response \[[^25]\]. Adiponectin, one of the exerkines secreted from adipocytes, can pass through blood brain barrier to reach the brain \[[^25]\]. Our finding that stress reduces adiponectin levels in both serum and mPFC in sedentary mice is consistent with previous animal studies \[[^30], [^70]\], which have shown that chronic social defeat stress significantly decreases adiponectin levels and correlates with depressive-like behaviors in mice. Notably, clinical studies suggested that lower serum adiponectin is associated with greater depression severity \[[^71]\]. The current study did not measure blood adiponectin levels 30 min post-exercise. In our subsequent study, we observed no significant increase in serum adiponectin levels immediately after single-bout exercise. However, we found a significant positive correlation between adiponectin levels and resting-state connectivity between the ACC and thalamus in healthy university students (*unpublished*). This finding is consistent to a previous study reporting no significant increase in serum adiponectin levels immediately post-exercise in healthy, untrained individuals \[[^72]\]. In contract, other studies have reported significant increases in serum adiponectin levels approximately 30 min after high-intensity exercise healthy, trained individuals \[[^73], [^74]\]. Future studies are warranted to examine effects of acute exercise on increasing blood adiponectin levels in different time points e.g. 30 min- or 60 min-post acute exercise, where elevated adiponectin levels may be detected using ELISA kits. Furthermore, future study should examine whether observable changes of blood adiponectin levels depends on exercise intensity in healthy, untrained participants, to further clarify the relationship between peripheral adiponectin levels and rapid antidepressant response indued by acute exercise in humans.

Our findings reveal that increased adiponectin levels in the mPFC of mice are negatively correlated with immobility time in the FST, observed 30 min post-exercise, suggesting adiponectin’s role in mediating exercise elicited rapid antidepressant response. This result corroborates one previous animal study demonstrating a positive correlation between brain adiponectin levels and antidepressant effects \[[^30]\]. However, this study involved intraventricular injection of adiponectin and did not investigate which brain regions were associated with antidepressant behavior. Our finding filled this gap to show that increased adiponectin in the mPFC rather than in hippocampus mediates such a rapid effect, where adult neurogenesis in hippocampus is crucial for the antidepressant effects of chronic voluntary exercise mediated by adiponectin \[[^25]\]. The antidepressant effects of acute exercise are rapid but short-lasting up to 24 h, whereas chronic exercise is known to produce more long-lasting antidepressant effects that involve hippocampal adult neurogenesis \[[^25]\]. Our current results demonstrate that AdipoR1 is required for a rapid antidepressant response. This is consistent with our previous finding that AdipoR1, rather than AdipoR2, plays a pivotal role in promoting hippocampal neurogenesis and mediating the antidepressant effects of chronic voluntary exercise \[[^25]\]. Notably, activation of adiponectin signaling with the adiponectin receptor agonist AdipoRon, which shows higher binding affinity to AdipoR1 relative to AdipoR2 \[[^75]\], can mimic some effects of physical exercise by promoting hippocampal synaptic plasticity and adult neurogenesis \[[^76]\]. Taken together, chronic activation of AdipoR1 may be essential for the long-lasting antidepressant effect of physical exercise, indicating the important role of AdipoR1 in regulating rapid and sustained antidepressant response.

Adiponectin regulates neuronal activity in different brain regions \[[^77],[^78],[^79],[^80],[^81]\]. Adiponectin inhibits dopaminergic neuron activity in the ventral tegmental area through AdipoR1 to regulate anxiety-like behavior \[[^80]\], and reduces hippocampal granule cell excitability in regulating the fear extinction \[[^81]\]. Furthermore, adiponectin induces neuronal hyperexcitation in the trigeminal ganglion, enhancing pain sensitivity through CK2α-dependent PKCβ1 interaction (coupled with AdipoR1) to stimulate Cav3.2 channels \[[^77]\]. An in vitro study demonstrated that adiponectin increases the excitability of layer V neurons in the ACC of acute brain slices \[[^79]\]. Our findings align with this result, further providing the in vivo evidence to show that adiponectin-AdipoR1 signaling is crucial for exercise-induced activation of ACC-glutamatergic neurons. In addition, these previous studies consistently demonstrate that adiponectin-AdipoR signaling regulates emotional and sensory responses by modulating neuronal excitability across various brain regions. Our findings further add evidence that adiponectin-AdipoR1 signaling is crucial for the rapid antidepressant effects of exercise by regulating ACC glutamatergic neuron activity.

APPL1 is a crucial component of adiponectin signaling, functioning as an adaptor protein that directly interacts with adiponectin receptors \[[^26]\]. In peripheral tissue cultures, like within aortic endothelial cells and human adipose-derived stem cells, APPL1 translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in response to adiponectin in a dose and time-dependent manner \[[^27], [^28]\]. We found that single-bout physical exercise drives APPL1’s nuclear translocation in ACC-glutamatergic neurons depending on adiponectin signaling. Considering no study to show the adiponectin-APPL1 translocation happens in the brain, our result provides the first evidence to show that this phenomenon also exists in the neurons. Notably, previous research indicates that knocking out APPL1 in glutamatergic neurons of the ventromedial PFC impairs the retrieval of fear extinction \[[^47]\]. Our findings focused on the ACC subregion of the dorsomedial PFC and found that APPL1 knockdown in ACC-glutamatergic neurons disrupts the rapid antidepressant effects of exercise. These findings suggest that APPL1 plays a key role in mood regulation in the PFC.

Previous study suggests that nuclear APPL1 disrupts the interaction between HDAC2 and the CREB promoter, leading to increased histone acetylation \[[^29]\]. Our findings are consistent with this phenomenon, showing that APPL1 nuclear translocation after exercise is essential for histone acetylation. Notably, ketamine induces transient phosphorylation and nuclear export of histone deacetylase 5 (HDAC5), thereby increasing histone acetylation at the MEF2 promoter \[[^82]\]. Despite targeting different promoters, both APPL1 nuclear import and HDAC5 nuclear export mechanisms enhance histone acetylation to ultimately elicit rapid antidepressant responses. Previous in vitro studies have shown that APPL1, located in the dendritic spines of cultured hippocampal neurons, translocates to the nucleus upon neuronal activation to facilitate the synaptic gene transcription necessary for maintaining late-phase long-term potentiation \[[^29]\]. Our current study extends the findings from gene transcription to synaptic protein expression level, revealing the increased synthesis of postsynaptic proteins such as PSD-95 and AMPA receptors, as well as presynaptic proteins like synapsin I and synaptophysin. Notably, although H4 acetylation returned to baseline at 24 h, both synaptic protein expression and antidepressant-like behaviors persisted. This suggests that the transient increase in H4 acetylation may initiate downstream synaptic protein changes that outlast the initial epigenetic modification and support sustained behavioral effects. Similar observations have been reported in previous studies. For example, Choi et al. reported that a single injection of ketamine induces rapid phosphorylation and nuclear export of HDAC5 peaking at 6 h post-injection, while global acetylation of Histone H3 and H4 increases by 55%, and mRNA expression is significantly increased at 24–48 h \[[^82]\]. Notably, the elevation of synaptic protein expression persisted up to 72 h post-injection \[[^12]\]. These molecular changes are associated with sustained antidepressant-like behavioral effects that last for 5–6 days after ketamine injection \[[^83]\], well beyond the duration of the epigenetic modifications, which peak at 6 h-post ketamine injection. However, the current study only verified the previously established mechanism of APPL1’s role in histone acetylation; future studies incorporating chromatin immunoprecipitation will be helpful to further determine whether other gene promoters, in addition to CREB promoters, are affected in the epigenetic mechanisms underlying the antidepressant effects of acute exercise.

Previous studies have established a link between the therapeutic effects of antidepressants and dendritic spine remodeling in the PFC. Individuals with depression and mice exhibiting depressive-like behaviors often display structural deficits in synapses within the PFC, including reduced synapse density and impaired dendritic spine formation \[[^84], [^85]\]. Rapid-acting antidepressants, such as ketamine and psilocybin, promote dendritic spine remodeling in the mPFC, thereby alleviating depressive symptoms \[[^12], [^48], [^84]\]. We found that pharmacological inhibition of the APPL1 nuclear translocation in the ACC abolished the exercise-induced new spine formation, together with the abolished rapid antidepressant effects. We conclude that nuclear APPL1-induced spinogenesis in the ACC following a single-bout exercise is required for rapid antidepressant action. Our findings are consistent with a previous study showing that spinogenesis is critically involved in rapid antidepressant action \[[^84]\].

In conclusion, our study demonstrates that single-bout physical exercise induces rapid antidepressant effects via the adiponectin-AdipoR1-APPL1 pathway in the ACC- glutamatergic neurons. This pathway involves the nuclear translocation of APPL1, which facilitates histone acetylation, enhances synaptic protein expression, and promotes spinogenesis. These molecular events provide a basis for the rapid antidepressant effects observed with single-bout physical exercise. The current finding not only suggests that activating AdipoR1 in the ACC could be a potential target for the development of rapid-acting antidepressants but highlights the potential of single-bout physical exercise as an effective and immediate intervention for alleviation of depressive mood.
