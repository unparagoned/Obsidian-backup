### Rationale

Depression is a common cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Depression is often treated with antidepressants or psychological therapy, or both, but some people may prefer alternative approaches such as exercise. This review updates one first published in 2008 and last updated in 2013.

### Objectives

To determine the effectiveness of exercise in the treatment of depression in adults compared with no intervention, waiting list control or placebo, or where exercise is used as an adjunct to an established treatment that is received by both exercising and non‐exercising groups.

To determine the effectiveness of exercise compared with other active interventions for depression in adults (psychological therapies, pharmacological treatments or alternative interventions such as light therapy).

### Search methods

We searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group’s Controlled Trials Register (CCDANCTR) to November 2013. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) from 2013 to November 2023. No date or language restrictions were applied.

### Eligibility criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which exercise was compared to no treatment, inactive treatment or active treatment in adults (aged 18 years and over) with depression. We included trials that randomised individual participants or clusters. We excluded trials of postnatal depression. Two authors independently undertook study selection.

### Outcomes

The primary outcome we assessed was a measure of depression or mood at the end of treatment and at any longer‐term follow‐up. Other outcomes were treatment acceptability, quality of life, cost and adverse events.

### Risk of bias

We assessed the risk of bias using the Cochrane risk of bias tool RoB 1. Two authors independently performed the risk of bias assessment.

### Synthesis methods

Two authors independently extracted data on outcomes at the end of the trial and end of follow‐up (if available). We calculated effect sizes for each trial using Hedges' *g* method and a mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) for the overall pooled effect for continuous data, and risk ratios for dichotomous data. Where trials used a number of different tools to assess depression, we included only the main outcome measure in our meta‐analyses. Where trials provided several 'doses' of exercise, we used data from the largest dose and performed sensitivity analysis using the lower dose. We performed subgroup analysis to explore the influence of diagnostic method, exercise intensity, number of exercise sessions, type of exercise and type of control (i.e. placebo, no treatment, waiting list, usual care and self monitoring). Through our sensitivity analyses, we explored the influence of study risk of bias.

### Included studies

We included 73 RCTs (at least 4985 participants) in the review, 69 of which contributed data to our meta‐analyses.

### Synthesis of results

For the 57 trials (2189 participants) comparing exercise with no treatment or a control intervention, the pooled SMD for depressive symptoms at the end of treatment was −0.67 (95% confidence interval (CI) −0.82 to −0.52; low‐certainty evidence), showing that exercise may result in a reduction in depressive symptoms. When we included only the seven trials (447 participants) with adequate allocation concealment, intention‐to‐treat analysis and blinded outcome assessment, the pooled SMD was smaller (SMD −0.46, 95% CI −0.88 to −0.04). Pooled data from the nine trials (405 participants) with long‐term follow‐up provided very uncertain evidence about the effect of exercise on depressive symptoms (SMD −0.53, 95% CI −1.11 to 0.06; very low certainty evidence).

Ten trials (414 participants) compared exercise with psychological therapy, finding there is probably little to no difference in their effect on depressive symptoms at the end of treatment (SMD 0.03, 95% CI −0.16 to 0.23; moderate‐certainty evidence). There were similar results at long‐term follow‐up (SMD −0.11, 95% CI ‐0.48 to 0.26; 4 studies, 114 participants; low‐certainty evidence).

Five trials (330 participants) compared exercise with pharmacological treatment, finding there may be little to no difference in their effect on depressive symptoms at the end of treatment (SMD −0.11, 95% CI −0.33 to 0.10; low‐certainty evidence). The evidence was very uncertain at long‐term follow‐up (SMD −0.40, 95% CI −0.80 to 0.00; 1 study, 58 participants; very low certainty evidence).

There did not appear to be a difference between exercise and other interventions in terms of treatment acceptability, as measured by participants completing the study (moderate to low certainty evidence).

Results for the outcome 'quality of life' were inconsistent (low to very low certainty evidence).

Adverse events were not common in any comparison, but included musculoskeletal injuries and depression affecting those undertaking exercise, and diarrhoea, sexual dysfunction and fatigue reported by those receiving sertraline.

Many trials were affected by multiple sources of bias: randomisation was adequately concealed in only 22 studies, only 31 used intention‐to‐treat analyses, and only 23 used blinded outcome assessors. Blinding of those receiving and those delivering the interventions is inherently difficult; we judged all studies to be at high risk of performance bias. Many trials used participant self‐report rating scales, which have the potential to bias findings.

### Authors' conclusions

Exercise may be moderately more effective than a control intervention for reducing symptoms of depression. Exercise appears to be no more or less effective than psychological or pharmacological treatments, though this conclusion is based on a few small trials. Long‐term follow‐up was rare.

The addition of 35 RCTs (at least 2526 participants) to this update has had very little effect on the estimate of the benefit of exercise on symptoms of depression. If further research is to take place, it should focus on improving trial quality, assessing which characteristics of exercise are effective for different people, and exploring health equity.

### Funding

The PICO model is widely used and taught in evidence-based health care as a strategy for formulating questions and search strategies and for characterizing clinical studies or meta-analyses. PICO stands for four different potential components of a clinical question: Patient, Population or Problem; Intervention; Comparison; Outcome.

### Is exercise effective for treating depression?

**Key messages**

- Exercise may be moderately effective compared to no therapy for reducing symptoms of depression.
- The evidence suggests there is little to no difference in the reduction of symptoms of depression provided by exercise compared to those provided by psychological therapies or antidepressants, but this conclusion is based on a few small studies.
- The studies measured the outcomes at the end of treatment, and most of them did not follow up participants in the longer term.
- Unwanted effects from exercise were not common, affecting only a small number of participants.

**What is depression?**

Depression is a common illness, affecting over 100 million people worldwide. Depression can have a significant impact on people’s physical health, as well as reducing their quality of life.

**How is depression treated?**

Research has shown that both pharmacological treatment (antidepressant medication) and psychological therapies (i.e. talking treatments aimed at changing people's thoughts, emotions, or behaviours) can be effective for treating depression. However, many people prefer to try alternative approaches. Some health guidelines suggest that exercise could be used as an alternative treatment.

**What did we want to find out?**

We wanted to find out if exercise reduces the symptoms of depression and improves quality of life in people with depression, and we wanted to find out how exercise compares to medication, psychological therapy and alternative treatments. We also wanted to find out if exercise is associated with any unwanted effects and if it provides good value for money. This review updates one last published in 2013.

**What did we do?**

We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (i.e. studies where people are assigned to a treatment group randomly) that assessed the effectiveness of exercise for treating depression in adults (18 years of age and over). Studies had to compare exercise with either another active treatment (e.g. medication or psychological therapy) or an inactive intervention (e.g. no treatment, being put on a waiting list, or being given a placebo treatment (i.e. an inactive treatment that seems like a real treatment)). All studies had to include adults with a diagnosis of depression, and the physical activity carried out had to fit our definition of 'exercise'.

We described, evaluated and summarised the results of the studies. We made a judgement about our confidence in the evidence based on factors such as the size of the studies and the methods used to conduct them. We searched medical databases for studies up to November 2023.

**What did we find?**

We found 73 studies that involved at least 4985 adults with depression. The risk of bias in some of the studies was high, which lowered our confidence in the findings.

Exercise may result in a reduction in depressive symptoms compared to no therapy, although the evidence about long‐term effects is uncertain.

There is probably little to no difference in depressive symptoms between people undertaking exercise and those receiving psychological therapy. There may be little to no difference in depressive symptoms between people doing exercise and those taking antidepressants.

There does not seem to be a difference between the different interventions in terms of their acceptability as treatments, as measured by the number of participants completing the studies.

The benefits of exercise compared to no therapy, psychological therapy or pharmacological treatments on quality of life are inconsistent and uncertain.

Adverse events from exercise were not common. The small number of participants who experienced them usually reported muscle and joint problems or worsening of depression.

**What are the limitations of the evidence?**

Many of the studies included a relatively small number of people and had a high risk of bias in terms of the research methods they used. Also, most studies only assessed the effects of exercise over a short period of time. These factors limit our confidence in the findings of the review. Future research should focus on improving the quality of the studies, working out which characteristics of exercise are effective for different people, and ensuring different types of people are included in the studies so that health equity issues can be considered.

### Implications for practice

Like previous systematic reviews and meta‐analyses, our review found that exercise may result in a reduction in depressive symptoms. Our review also found that people undertaking light or moderate intensity exercise may have a larger benefit than those undertaking vigorous exercise, and that between 13 and 36 sessions of exercise may be more beneficial than either fewer or more sessions. We are less certain which type of exercise is most beneficial. Long‐term follow‐up was lacking in most of the studies, which means that the duration of any benefits is unclear, although those reported appeared to decline over time following completion of the exercise programme.

The evidence also suggests that exercise is probably as effective as psychological therapies and may be as effective as pharmacological treatments, but the number of trials reporting these comparisons was small, as was the number of participants randomised.

#### Equity‐related implications for practice

The review does not directly address equity issues, partly due to the initial framing of the review in its first and subsequent versions, but also due to the lack of consideration of this aspect within the included trials. This is an issue that is starting to be addressed in trials and this should come through within systematic reviews. Most trials in the review focused on participants with depression, without ensuring that there was representation of different groups within the population (other than specific age ranges or sex groups), which makes it difficult to make any meaningful assessment of equity issues.

### Implications for research

This review would be strengthened by additional large‐scale high‐quality studies where all participants at the time of recruitment were diagnosed as having depression through clinical interview, and where they adhered closely to an exercise regimen as a sole intervention and were further assessed through diagnostic clinical interview post‐intervention. Participants should come from a broad range of backgrounds to ensure studies are not selective and findings are generalisable. Studies should explore which types, intensities and number of exercise sessions are effective for different types of participants. It would also be worth considering whether any long‐lasting effects of exercise correlate with sustained increases in physical activity over time. Given the use of psychological therapies and pharmacological treatments, further research should be undertaken comparing these interventions with exercise. In addition, economic evaluations should routinely be undertaken as part of trials to assess cost‐effectiveness. Although further high‐quality focused research would improve the evidence base, it is not clear if such RCTs would be commissioned. This concern is based on the lack of improvement in the quality of the RCTs found for this review over the last 12 years and the limited change in the estimates of effect that has come from doubling the number of trials included in this systematic review.

A future update of the current review will only be valuable if large‐scale and high‐quality trials are conducted, and if these trials give consideration to equity issues.

#### Equity‐related implications for research

Equity should be a focus of any future update of this review. It will necessitate a re‐examination of the included trials to identify any consideration of equity in them. Given the limited consideration of equity in trials to date, any future trials should address equity issues and funders should make this a key part of commissioning research.

Although it is a global concern, the effects of depression have been felt disproportionately in low‐ and middle‐income countries, where over 80% of the world's non‐fatal disease burden and 78% of suicides were reported in 2015 \[[3](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-bib-0003 "World Health Organization.

Depression encompasses a broad and varied range of mental health concerns. It is typified by persistent low mood; sadness; loss of pleasure in most activities and experiences; and is associated with emotional, cognitive, physical and behavioural symptoms \[[10](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-bib-0010 "National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. Depression in adults: recognition and management. http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/CG902009.")\]. People with depression may experience a loss of energy, a change in appetite, altered sleep patterns, anxiety, reduced concentration, indecisiveness, restlessness, feelings of worthlessness, guilt or hopelessness, and thoughts of self‐harm or suicide \[[3](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-bib-0003 "World Health Organization. Depression and other common mental disorders. Global health estimates. https://www.who.int/mental_health/management/depression/prevalence_global_health_estimates/en/2017.")\]. It can be a long‐lasting or recurring condition, affecting a person’s ability to function and cope with daily life. The diagnosis and the severity of depression are determined by the extent of the symptoms incurred and the level of functional impairment. The fifth edition of the Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM‐V) classifies major depressive disorders as the occurrence of at least five out of nine symptoms and a decline in a person’s daily functioning \[[11](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-bib-0011 "American Psychiatric Association. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition. Arlington: Arlington, 2013. [DOI: 10.1176/appi.books.9780890425596]")\]. The effects and severity of these symptoms have to be felt throughout each day and persist for at least two weeks \[[10](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-bib-0010 "National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence.

Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition. Arlington: Arlington, 2013. [DOI: 10.1176/appi.books.9780890425596]")\]. Importantly, at least one of the symptoms experienced has to be depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure \[[11](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-bib-0011 "American Psychiatric Association. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition. Arlington: Arlington, 2013. [DOI: 10.1176/appi.books.9780890425596]")\]. The DSM‐V classifies severity of depression into three categories: mild (a few symptoms more than is required for diagnosis but these do not have a significant impact), moderate (number and intensity of symptoms between mild and severe) and severe (number of symptoms are substantially above what is required for diagnosis and subsequent symptoms are unmanageable and distressing, and interfere with social and occupational functioning) \[[11](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-bib-0011 "American Psychiatric Association.

### Description of the intervention and how it might work

Depression is treatable. It is treated with antidepressants, psychological therapies, alternative approaches or a combination of these options. Antidepressants are effective for the treatment of depression in primary care, especially for people with more than minor depression \[[12](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-bib-0012 "ArrollB , ElleyCR , FishmanT , Goodyear-SmithFA , KenealyT , BlashkiG , et al. Antidepressants versus placebo for depression in primary care. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews2009, Issue 3. Art. No: CD007954.

Efficacy and acceptability of pharmacological treatments for depressive disorders in primary care: systematic review and network meta-analysis. Annals of Family Medicine2015;13(1):69–79.")\]. In addition to benefiting the acutely ill, antidepressants can help reduce the risk of relapse into depression \[[10](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-bib-0010 "National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence.

Recommendations for their use are often as part of combined treatment with high‐intensity psychological interventions (cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) or interpersonal therapy (IPT)) \[[10](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-bib-0010 "National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence.

Depression in adults: treatment and management. https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng2222022.")\]. The effectiveness of antidepressants in managing depression may be tempered by several concerns, including: adverse side effects that impact on people’s health and quality of life \[[16](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-bib-0016 "FergusonJM .

The increasing consideration given to exercise as an approach to managing depression has been reflected in recent clinical guidelines that have emerged from national and professional policy bodies, although the definition of exercise and the extent of recommendations differ. In England in 2022, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) published a guideline on the treatment and management of depression in adults \[[15](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-bib-0015 "NICE. Depression in adults: treatment and management. https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng2222022.")\]. It advises that people doing any form of physical activity on a regular basis (e.g. walking, jogging, swimming, dance, gardening) could enhance their sense of wellbeing. Moreover, undertaking the activity outdoors can provide greater benefits. As a treatment option for both severe and mild‐to‐moderate depression, group physical activity interventions (usually for a group of eight participants) that are specifically designed for people with depression are recommended. These interventions should be provided by trained practitioners, usually consist of one session per week for 10 weeks, include moderate‐intensity aerobic exercise and not directly target thoughts and feelings \[[15](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-bib-0015 "NICE. Depression in adults: treatment and management. https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng2222022.")\]. For people with more severe depression, consideration should be given to other treatment options and more contact with therapists should be considered carefully before recommending group exercise \[[15](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-bib-0015 "NICE. Depression in adults: treatment and management. https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng2222022.")\]. The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists (RANZCP) advises that exercise should be recommended to all patients due to the known health benefits \[[44](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-bib-0044 "MalhiGS , BellE , BassettD , BoyceP , BryantR , HazellP , et al.

[DOI: 10.1177/0004867420979353]")\]. Although RANZCP recommend aerobic exercise, they recognise that a combination of aerobic and resistance exercise is probably optimal. RANZCP note some uncertainty around the optimal amount and intensity, indicating that it should be set at a level that demands sustained concentration and effort \[[58](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-bib-0058 "MalhiGS , BellE , BassettD , BoyceP , BryantR , HazellP , et al.

The Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) recommends that supervised exercise of low to moderate intensity for 30 to 40 minutes per session, three to four times a week for at least nine weeks is effective as first‐line monotherapy for mild depression and as second‐line adjunctive treatment for moderate severity illness \[[29](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-bib-0029 "ParikhSV , SegalZV , GrigoriadisS , RavindranAV , KennedySH , LamRW , et al.

Portuguese and Brazilian guidelines for the treatment of depression: exercise as medicine. Brazilian Journal of Psychiatry2017;40(2):210-1.")\]. In contrast, guidance in the USA is equivocal. Although the American Psychiatric Association makes no specific recommendation concerning the role of exercise for treating depression, other agencies identify benefits associated with exercise in treating depression \[[24](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-bib-0024 "American Psychological Association. APA clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts. Available at https://www.apa.org/depression-guideline/guideline.pdf2019.")\]. The American Psychological Association recommends exercise as a monotherapy for adults with depression for whom psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy is ineffective or unacceptable \[[24](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-bib-0024 "American Psychological Association.

The focus of this systematic review is on assessing the effectiveness of exercise for treating depression. The review does not consider the influence of any referral schemes or broader programmes of care. The review will use the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) criteria to define the concept of exercise. Given that there are many forms of bodily movement or physical activity that differ in their characteristics, it is important to provide some clarity regarding those that will be included in this review.

Depression and low levels of physical activity have been shown to be closely associated in a two‐way relationship \[[62](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-bib-0062 "Roshanaei-MoghaddamB , KatonWJ , RussoJ .

[DOI: 10.1016/j.mhpa.2024.100599]")\]. While depression can lead to decreased levels of exercise through low motivation and energy, it is also evident that low levels of physical activity are a risk factor for people developing low mood and depression \[[62](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-bib-0062 "Roshanaei-MoghaddamB , KatonWJ , RussoJ .

Although such an association does not necessarily imply causality, there are plausible reasons why physical activity and exercise may improve mood \[[32](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-bib-0032 "CooneyGM , DwanK , GreigCA , LawlorDA , RimerJ , WaughFR , et al.

Self‐efficacy may provide the mechanism by which exercise might have an antidepressant effect; people who experience an improvement in mood following exercise show higher self‐efficacy levels at three weeks and nine weeks post‐exercise \[[68](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-bib-0068 "CraftLL .

Self‐efficacy has been found to be intricately linked with self‐esteem, which, in turn, is considered to be one of the strongest predictors of overall subjective well‐being \[[69](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-bib-0069 "DienerE .

Despite these systematic reviews all having a focus on adults with major depressive disorders, the criteria used for diagnosing depression, and for establishing its severity, have varied. Importantly, these criteria were often the primary outcome measures for assessing the effectiveness of the interventions. Diagnosis has occurred through clinical interviews \[[53](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-bib-0053 "DanielssonL , NorasAM , WaernM , CarlssonJ .

Given the heterogeneous nature of the evidence base assessing exercise as a treatment for depression, it is important to be transparent and consistent about the different decisions made regarding the methods that have been adopted. Also, it is important to recognise that differences will exist between different systematic reviews and meta‐analyses, interpreting the results within the context of the evidence presented. This review has continued to evolve, having originally been published in 2001 in the British Medical Journal \[[102](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-bib-0102 "LawlorDA , HopkerSW .

Physical exercise intervention in depressive disorders: meta-analysis and systematic review. Scandinavian Journal of Medicine & Science in Sports2014;24(2):259-72.")\]. Our intention in this review is to update the evidence base and to address any issues that have arisen in the assessment of the effectiveness of exercise for treating depression. Changes made to the scope of the review and the methods used are described below under ‘Differences between protocol and review’.

To determine the effectiveness of exercise in the treatment of depression in adults compared with no intervention, waiting list control or placebo, or where exercise is used as an adjunct to an established treatment that is received by both exercising and non‐exercising groups.

To determine the effectiveness of exercise compared with other active interventions for depression in adults (psychological therapies, pharmacological treatments or alternative interventions such as light therapy).

We followed the Methodological Expectations of Cochrane Intervention Reviews (MECIR) \[[109](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-bib-0109 "HigginsJ , LassersonT , ThomasJ , FlemyngE , ChurchillR .

### Differences between protocol and review

#### Changes for this update (2025 version)

- We performed an additional sensitivity analysis to explore the effect of excluding those trials for which we used the arm with the largest clinical effect rather than the largest 'dose' of exercise.
- We specified a new analysis that assessed 'other' interventions, which included bright light therapy, reflexology, occupational or art therapy, supplements and health education.
- Some studies with a control arm that had been specified as placebo in previous versions of the review have been reclassified as specific active therapies in this 2025 update.
- We modified our categorisation of the intensity of exercise in the studies to align with ACSM criteria.
- We undertook new subgroup analyses to look at the effects of exercise when given as an adjunct.

### Criteria for considering studies for this review

#### Types of studies

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including parallel, cluster, or individual, or the first phase of cross‐over trials. We defined a trial as an RCT if the allocation of participants to intervention and comparison groups was described as randomised (including terms such as 'randomly', 'random' or 'randomisation').

#### Types of participants

##### Participant characteristics

Adult men and women aged 18 and over (with no upper age limit) in any setting, including inpatients. We included studies if the participants were defined by the author of the trial as having depression (by any method of diagnosis and of any severity). We excluded trials that randomised people both with and without depression, even if results from the subgroups of participants with depression were reported separately, in keeping with what was done in previous versions of this review \[[32](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-bib-0032 "CooneyGM , DwanK , GreigCA , LawlorDA , RimerJ , WaughFR , et al.

##### Diagnosis

The effects of exercise on depressive symptoms in participants with emotional distress (but not fulfilling a diagnosis of depression) or those who are healthy were not included in this review. We acknowledge that it can sometimes be difficult to distinguish between depression and dysthymia in the 'real world', as there need be only two weeks of decreased interest and enjoyment to diagnose depression. However, we were primarily interested in the role of exercise in people with depression for whom there is substantial morbidity rather than in people with mild, transient episodes of low mood.

We did not include studies that investigated the effect of exercise on anxiety and neurotic disorders, dysthymia (i.e. low mood not fulfilling diagnostic criteria for depression) or postnatal depression.

##### Comorbidities

We did not exclude studies or participants based on comorbidities.

##### Setting

Any setting was eligible for inclusion in the review.

#### Types of interventions

We defined exercise as “planned, structured and repetitive bodily movement done to improve or maintain one or more components of physical fitness” \[[46](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-bib-0046 "American College of Sports Medicine. ACSM's Resource Manual for Guidelines for Exercise Testing and Prescription. 4th edition. Lippincott, Williams and Wilkins, 2001.")\]. This definition has been applied since the previous update \[[32](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-bib-0032 "CooneyGM , DwanK , GreigCA , LawlorDA , RimerJ , WaughFR , et al. Exercise for depression. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews2013, Issue 9. Art. No: CD004366. [DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub6]")\] and it was agreed to continue its use for future updates by the CCDAN Review Group editorial team. We also excluded studies that assessed the provision of advice on how to increase physical activity that does not fulfil the ACSM definition of exercise.

##### Experimental intervention

Any type of exercise (as defined above). We excluded studies that measured outcomes immediately before and after a single exercise session, and trials that provided less than a week of exercise.

##### Comparator intervention

We included studies in which exercise was compared to no intervention, a 'waiting list control' or placebo (defined by study authors); and those in which exercise was used as an adjunct to an established treatment (which was received (in an identical way) by participants in both the exercising and non‐exercising group, e.g. exercise plus cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) versus CBT alone).

We also included other types of active treatments, where the aim of the treatment was to improve mood. This included pharmacological treatments, psychological therapies or other alternative treatments. Where a study identified a comparator as placebo and stated it was an active treatment, whether pharmacological, psychological or other therapies, we classified it as the specified active therapy.

Although this strategy was the same as that included in the original review \[[102](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-bib-0102 "LawlorDA , HopkerSW . The effectiveness of exercise as an intervention in the management of depression: systematic review and meta-regression analysis of randomised controlled trials. BMJ (Clinical Research Ed.)2001;322(7289):763-7.")\], some studies that were specified as placebo in previous versions have been reclassified as specific active therapies in this 2025 update. We made this change only when the interventions were clearly stated and the comparator was included in an analysis.

We excluded studies that compared two different types of exercise but had no non‐exercising comparison group.

We excluded studies described by the authors as 'combination treatments', where exercise was one component of the combination, because we could not disentangle the effect of exercise from the effect of the other components of the intervention.

### Outcome measures

#### Critical outcomes

- Our primary outcome was a measure of depression or mood, either continuous or dichotomous. Continuous measures of depression were reported using a variety of depression scales, the most common of which were the Beck Depression Inventory \[[111](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-bib-0111 "BeckAT , WardCH , MendelsonM , MockJ , ErbaughJ . An inventory for measuring depression. Archives of General Psychiatry1961;4(6):561-71.")\] and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression \[[112](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-bib-0112 "HamiltonM . A rating scale for depression. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Psychiatry1960;23:56-62.")\].

In previous versions of the review, where trials used a number of different tools to assess depression, we included only the main outcome measure in the meta‐analysis. We defined the main outcome measure using a hierarchy of criteria: i) identified by the trial authors as the main outcome measure, ii) outcome reported in the abstract, iii) first outcome reported in the Results section.

Where trials used dichotomous data for primary outcomes, and also provided data on continuous outcome measures, we used the data provided in the trial reports for the continuous outcome measure in our meta‐analysis. This was because we knew from previous updates that most trials reported only continuous outcomes.

##### Timing of outcome assessment

We extracted data at the end of treatment and also at the end of any longer‐term follow‐up after the intervention had stopped.

#### Important outcomes

- Acceptability of treatment, assessed by a) attendance at exercise interventions, and b) the number of participants completing the interventions
- Quality of life (e.g. SF‐36 Health Survey \[[113](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-bib-0113 "Ware JE Jr,  SherbourneCD . The MOS 36-item short-form health survey (SF-36). I. Conceptual framework and item selection. Medical Care1992;30(6):473-83.")\], health‐related quality of life)
- Cost (e.g. average treatment cost, health service costs)
- Adverse events (e.g. musculoskeletal pain, fatigue)
- In order to better understand the generalisability of exercise for depression, we also extracted data on the number of people screened for inclusion and the number recruited ([Table 1](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-tbl-0005)).

### Search methods for identification of studies

#### Electronic searches

We carried out the following electronic searches ([Supplementary material 1](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-supitem-0001)).

- The Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group's Specialised Register (CCDANCTR) (February 2010 to February 2016)
- The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), in the Cochrane Library (February 2010 to November 2023)
- MEDLINE Ovid (February 2010 to November 2023)
- EMBASE Ovid (February 2010 to November 2023)
- PsycINFO (February 2010 to November 2023)

The searches of MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and CENTRAL between 2010 and 2016 were encompassed within our searches of CCDANCTR, which included these databases. Also, we searched the ISRCTN Registry (in March 2013, January 2017, February 2019, November 2020, July 2021 and September 2025) to identify any ongoing trials. We performed an electronic search of ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) in March 2013, January 2017, February 2019, November 2020, July 2021 and September 2025. An RCT filter developed by CCDAN was used.

Because the searches for the CDCANCTR register were kept up‐to‐date and comprehensive, we were advised by the CCDAN editorial team that it was not necessary to search the other databases until the November 2019 update search.

We searched for errata and retractions for the included studies by searching for the papers on MEDLINE and Embase, and checking those records, updates on the publisher’s website and the Retraction Watch database.

Previous updates of the review provide details of the search strategy prior to the searches conducted for the current update \[[32](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-bib-0032 "CooneyGM , DwanK , GreigCA , LawlorDA , RimerJ , WaughFR , et al.

Exercise for depression. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews2008, Issue 4. Art. No: CD004366. [DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub3]")\].

#### Searching other resources

Due to limitations in available resources for this current update, we did not repeat handsearching conducted in previous updates. We contacted authors only to obtain any missing information about trial details (e.g. standard deviations).

We screened the bibliographies of all included articles for additional references.

### Data collection and analysis

#### Selection of studies

We selected studies through a two‐stage process. The full literature search results were independently screened by pairs of review authors (JH, DM, CL, AC, CH, CS, KD), identifying all those citations that may meet the selection criteria. Full manuscripts of all selected citations were then retrieved and assessed independently by the pairs of review authors against the study selection criteria. Any differences in opinion were resolved through consensus or, if necessary, by arbitration by a third review author who was independent of the original decision. For the searches of the CCDANCTR up to February 2020, their Trials Search Co‐ordinator/Information Specialist checked abstracts, excluded obviously irrelevant ones, and then sent a list of the remaining citations to the review authors for scrutiny. We created a PRISMA flow diagram to outline the study selection process.

#### Data extraction and management

We extracted data, when available, at the end of treatment and at the end of follow‐up. For this update, seven review authors (JH, DM, AC, CH, CS, CL, KD) independently extracted data for our primary and secondary outcomes for the new trials identified. All authors, working in pairs, verified extracted data from a subset of included studies. If differences in opinion occurred, these were resolved by discussion, or, if necessary, through recourse to a third review author. The data we extracted were participants, interventions, outcome measures, results, number of people screened, number randomised, number allocated to exercise, number who dropped out of the exercise arm ([Table 1](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-tbl-0005)), secondary clinical outcomes, cost, adverse events and main conclusions. All the review authors used the same structured paper extraction form, which had been piloted.

In addition, we extracted data on the type of exercise from all the included trials, to enable a categorisation of the intensity of exercise according to ACSM criteria. This was undertaken by one author (JH) and checked by a second author (DM or AC). In categorising the intensity levels in this updated version of the review, we made a readjustment to maintain the five‐intensity‐level categorisation stated in the ACSM criteria \[[115](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-bib-0115 "GarberCE , BlissmerB , DeschenesMR , FranklinBA , LamonteMJ , LeeIM , et al.

Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise2011;43(7):1334-59.")\], which are very light, light, moderate, vigorous and near maximum to maximum. Wherever possible, we used direct measures to estimate the intensity levels (percentage of heart rate reserve, percentage of oxygen uptake reserve, percentage of maximum heart rate and one‐maximum‐repetition percentage) \[[116](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-bib-0116 "HowleyET . Type of activity: resistance, aerobic and leisure versus occupational physical activity. Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise2001;33(6):s419-20. [DOI: 10.1097/00005768-200106001-00005]")\]. Where this was not available, an indirect measure was utilised. If available, the classification from the author was used; if not, a classification of the type of exercise metabolic equivalent (METs) was derived from the Compendium of Physical Activities ([https://sites.google.com/site/compendiumofphysicalactivities/Activity](https://sites.google.com/site/compendiumofphysicalactivities/Activity)). All measurements of intensity were then cross‐referenced to approximate the classification of exercise intensity ACSM criteria \[[115](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-bib-0115 "GarberCE , BlissmerB , DeschenesMR , FranklinBA , LamonteMJ , LeeIM , et al. American College of Sports Medicine position stand. Quantity and quality of exercise for developing and maintaining cardiorespiratory, musculoskeletal, and neuromotor fitness in apparently healthy adults: guidance for prescribing exercise. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise2011;43(7):1334-59.")\]. For the MET values, when given, age was taken into consideration using the mean age (if reported). Wherever possible, we calculated 'triangulation of intensity levels'. If multiple intensity levels were used throughout the session/intervention, the programme intensity that represented most of the session/intervention programme was classified as the intervention intensity level. Where multiple direct and indirect conflicting measurements were given for relative intensity levels, we used the direct measure to classify the exercise intensity compared to indirect measures. Where a range of direct or indirect measures were given that crossed two levels of intensity, the intensity level was set where most of the overlap occurred. Where two intensity levels were described within the intervention, we selected the intensity level that represented most of the session or programme as the overall intensity level.

##### Main comparisons

We undertook the following analyses.

- Exercise versus 'control' (as defined above)
- Exercise versus psychological therapies
- Exercise versus pharmacological treatments
- Exercise versus 'other' interventions (including bright light therapy, reflexology, occupational or art therapy, supplements, health education)

#### Risk of bias assessment in included studies

We used the Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias tool to assess risks of bias, according to Chapter 8 of the *Cochrane Handbook for* *Systematic Reviews of Interventions* \[[117](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-bib-0117 "HigginsJP , ThomasJ , ChandlerJ , CumpstonM , LiT , PageMJ , et al (editors). Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions version 6.0 (updated July 2019). Available from https://www.cochrane.org/handbook.")\]. Two review authors (from JH, AC, DM, CH, CS, CL, KD) independently extracted data from each study on random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants, blinding of those delivering the intervention, blinding of outcome assessors, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting and other potential biases. We categorised each of these domains as being at high risk of bias, unclear risk of bias or low risk of bias. All authors met in pairs to check decisions. We resolved any differences through discussion—or recourse to a third review author when necessary.

For concealment of allocation, we distinguished between trials that were adequately concealed (central randomisation at a site remote from the study; computerised allocation in which records are in a locked, unreadable file that can be assessed only after entering participant details; the drawing of opaque envelopes), inadequately concealed (open lists or tables of random numbers; open computer systems; drawing of non‐opaque envelopes) and unclear (no information in report, and the authors either did not respond to requests for information or were unable to provide information).

Trials could only be defined as 'intention‐to‐treat' if participants were analysed according to the allocated treatment and all participants either completed allocated treatments or any missing outcome data were replaced using a recognised statistical method (e.g. last observation carried forward (LOCF)).

For blinding, we distinguished between trials in which the main outcome was measured by an assessor who was blind to treatment allocation (blind) and those in which the main outcome was measured either by the participants themselves (i.e. self report) or by a non‐blinded assessor (not blind).

#### Measures of treatment effect

We undertook a narrative review of all studies and a meta‐analysis of those studies with appropriate data. Where trials used a number of different tools to assess depression, we included the main outcome measure only in the meta‐analysis. The main outcome measure was defined using a hierarchy of criteria as follows: identified by the authors as the main outcome measure; outcome reported in the abstract; first outcome reported in the Results section. For continuous data where different scales were used, the standardised mean difference (SMD) was calculated and reported with a 95% confidence interval (CI). For dichotomous data, we calculated the risk ratio and reported this with a 95% CI.

We interpreted the SMDs using the following rule of thumb: 0.2 represents a small effect, 0.5 a moderate effect and 0.8 a large effect \[[118](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-bib-0118 "SchünemannHJ , OxmanAD , VistGE , HigginsJP , DeeksJJ , GlasziouP , et al. Chapter 12: Interpreting results and drawing conclusions. In: Higgins JP, Green S. Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions Version 5.1.0 (updated March 2011). The Cochrane Collaboration, 2011. Available from https://www.cochrane.handbook.org.")\]. We planned to pool follow‐up data from those trials that reassessed participants at the end of the intervention and at subsequent time points (long‐term follow‐up). Long‐term follow‐up could mean an assessment at any point of time (after the initial assessment) after the intervention had been completed.

#### Unit of analysis issues

##### Studies with multiple treatment groups

Where studies with multiple treatment groups included a control arm, an exercise arm and an 'established treatment' arm (e.g. CBT, antidepressants), we extracted data on exercise versus control, and exercise versus established treatment. This meant that data from the exercise arm were included in two separate comparisons. If trials compared an established treatment (e.g. CBT, antidepressants) versus exercise versus both the established treatment and exercise, we made two comparisons: (i) established treatment plus exercise versus established treatment alone, and included this in the meta‐analysis of treatment versus control; (ii) exercise versus established treatment (e.g. CBT, antidepressants). This means that data from the 'established treatment alone' arm was used in two separate comparisons. In the review versions in 2001 \[[102](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-bib-0102 "LawlorDA , HopkerSW . The effectiveness of exercise as an intervention in the management of depression: systematic review and meta-regression analysis of randomised controlled trials. BMJ (Clinical Research Ed.)2001;322(7289):763-7.")\], 2009 \[[99](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-bib-0099 "MeadGE , MorleyW , CampbellP , GreigCA , McMurdoM , LawlorDA . Exercise for depression. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews2009, Issue 3. Art. No: CD004366. [DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub4]")\] and 2012 \[[108](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-bib-0108 "RimerJ , DwanK , LawlorDA , GreigCA , McMurdoM , MorleyW , et al. Exercise for depression. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews2012, Issue 7. Art. No: CD004366. [DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub5]")\], for trials that included more than one intensity of exercise, we used the exercise arm with the greatest clinical effect. Similarly, when trials provided more than one type of exercise, we used the type of exercise with the greatest clinical effect. However, because this may overestimate the effect of exercise, in this and the previous update of the review \[[32](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-bib-0032 "CooneyGM , DwanK , GreigCA , LawlorDA , RimerJ , WaughFR , et al. Exercise for depression. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews2013, Issue 9. Art. No: CD004366. [DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub6]")\], the exercise arm that provides the biggest 'dose' of exercise was used, and we performed a sensitivity analysis to explore the effect of using the smallest dose.

##### Cross‐over trials

For cross‐over trials, we intended to use the first phase of the trial only due to the potential 'carry‐over' effect of exercise. To date, we have not included any cross‐over trials.

##### Cluster‐randomised trials

If we identified cluster‐randomised trials that were incorrectly analysed using individuals as the unit of analysis, we intended to make corrections using the intracluster correlation coefficient (ICC). If this had not been available, we would have imputed the ICC from similar studies. In fact, we did not find any cluster‐RCTs to include.

#### Dealing with missing data

In two previous versions of this review \[[99](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-bib-0099 "MeadGE , MorleyW , CampbellP , GreigCA , McMurdoM , LawlorDA . Exercise for depression. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews2009, Issue 3. Art. No: CD004366. [DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub4]"), [102](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-bib-0102 "LawlorDA , HopkerSW . The effectiveness of exercise as an intervention in the management of depression: systematic review and meta-regression analysis of randomised controlled trials. BMJ (Clinical Research Ed.)2001;322(7289):763-7.")\], we found current contact details of all authors through correspondence addresses in study reports and by searching websites. We contacted all authors by email or post (sending reminders to non‐responders) to establish missing details from the methods and results sections of the written reports and to determine authors’ knowledge of, or involvement in, any current work in the area. For the last two updates \[[32](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-bib-0032 "CooneyGM , DwanK , GreigCA , LawlorDA , RimerJ , WaughFR , et al. Exercise for depression. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews2013, Issue 9. Art. No: CD004366. [DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub6]"), [108](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-bib-0108 "RimerJ , DwanK , LawlorDA , GreigCA , McMurdoM , MorleyW , et al. Exercise for depression. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews2012, Issue 7. Art. No: CD004366. [DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub5]")\] and this 2025 update, we contacted authors only if there were missing data items, or if we needed more detail to determine whether to include the study.

Some trials, in which participants dropped out, reported data from only the remaining participants, so we used these data in our meta‐analyses. For trials that attempted to impute data from missing participants (e.g. LOCF for continuous data), we used the imputed values and categorised the trial as 'intention‐to‐treat'. When we could not obtain information either from the publication or from the authors, we classified the trial as 'not intention‐to‐treat', and used the data from the available cases in the meta‐analysis.

#### Reporting bias assessment

We used a funnel plot to explore reporting biases when 10 or more studies were included in the meta‐analysis. However, other reasons such as heterogeneity and small‐study effects also cause asymmetry in funnel plots \[[117](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-bib-0117 "HigginsJP , ThomasJ , ChandlerJ , CumpstonM , LiT , PageMJ , et al (editors). Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions version 6.0 (updated July 2019). Available from https://www.cochrane.org/handbook.")\].

#### Synthesis methods

We used a random‐effects model based on DerSimonian and Laird’s method to calculate the pooled effect size \[[119](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-bib-0119 "DerSimonianR , LairdN . Meta-analysis in clinical trials. Controlled Clinical Trials1986;7(3):177-88.")\], using a standardised mean difference where studies measured the same outcome but used different scales. Where studies used the same scales for the outcome or there was only one included study, we presented a mean difference. We synthesised data from trials where outcome data were collected as soon as the intervention ended, and performed a separate synthesis of data collected weeks or months after the intervention ended, to explore whether any benefits were retained after the intervention had been completed. With complex interventions, we had to decide whether the interventions were sufficiently similar to be combined into a meta‐analysis. We included trials that fulfilled the ACSM definition of exercise \[[46](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-bib-0046 "American College of Sports Medicine. ACSM's Resource Manual for Guidelines for Exercise Testing and Prescription. 4th edition. Lippincott, Williams and Wilkins, 2001.")\], and we combined these data in a meta‐analysis.

We used the Chi² test, together with the I² statistic, to assess heterogeneity.

A P value of 0.1 or less indicates significant heterogeneity when considering Chi². The ranges for I² are:

- 0% to 40%: might not be important;
- 30% to 60%: may represent moderate heterogeneity;
- 50% to 90%: may represent substantial heterogeneity;
- 75% to 100%: considerable heterogeneity.

Note that the importance of the observed value of I² depends on (i) the magnitude and direction of effects and (ii) the strength of evidence for heterogeneity (e.g. P value from the Chi² test, or a confidence interval for I²) \[[117](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-bib-0117 "HigginsJP , ThomasJ , ChandlerJ , CumpstonM , LiT , PageMJ , et al (editors). Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions version 6.0 (updated July 2019). Available from https://www.cochrane.org/handbook.")\].

#### Investigation of heterogeneity and subgroup analysis

We conducted subgroup analyses on studies comparing exercise versus control, with all subgroup analyses prespecified in the protocol used for the current and previous versions of the review.

- Type of exercise
	- In this update, like the previous update, we explored the effect of different types of exercise (aerobic, resistance exercise or mixed aerobic and resistance) for those trials comparing exercise versus control on the primary outcome of reduction in depression symptoms.
- Intensity of exercise
	- In this update, like the previous update, we explored the effects of the intensity of exercise on the primary outcome of reduction in depression symptoms through a subgroup analysis that subdivided intensity of exercise into very light, light, moderate, vigorous, near maximum to maximum.
- Number of exercise sessions
	- In this update, like the previous update, we explored the effect of the number of exercise sessions on reduction in depression symptoms, by extracting data on the length of the exercise programme and the frequency of exercise sessions. We categorised studies by the total number of sessions and then grouped the total number as 0 to 12, 13 to 24, 25 to 36, at least 37.
- Diagnosis of depression
	- In this update, like the previous update, we explored how the diagnosis of depression at baseline (using a cut‐point on a scale, or by psychiatric interview) influenced the effect of exercise on reduction in depressive symptoms at the end of treatment.
- Type of control
	- Given concerns raised about the potential additive effects of the use of exercise as an adjunct to an established treatment received in an identical way by participants in both exercising and non‐exercising groups (e.g. exercise plus CBT versus CBT alone), we undertook new subgroup analyses to look at these effects separately on the reduction in depressive symptoms. This was part of a subgroup analysis that encompassed the different types of control.

#### Sensitivity analysis

We undertook sensitivity analyses to explore how much of the variation between studies comparing exercise to no exercise is explained by between‐study differences of the following types.

- Publication type (peer‐reviewed journal, conference abstract/proceedings, doctoral dissertation)
- Allocation concealment
- Intention‐to‐treat analysis (as defined above)
- Blinding
- Treatment dose

We then performed a sensitivity analysis, as we had done previously, including trials that were at low risk of bias for all three key criteria: allocation concealment, intention‐to‐treat, blinding. We also performed a sensitivity analysis using those trials that had several arms, for which we had included the arm with the biggest 'dose' of exercise in the initial analysis. In this sensitivity analysis, we included the arm with the smallest dose.

#### Certainty of the evidence assessment

##### Summary of findings tables

We created summary of findings tables for the comparisons of exercise versus (1) all non‐active control types; (2) psychological therapy; (3) pharmacological treatment and (4) specific non‐active control types (subgroup analyses). We generated the tables in GRADEpro GDT software \[[120](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-bib-0120 "SchünemannH , BrożekJ , GuyattG , OxmanA , editors. GRADE handbook for grading quality of evidence and strength of recommendations. Updated October 2013. The GRADE Working Group. Available from https://guidelinedevelopment.org/handbook2013.")\]. The outcomes presented were depressive symptoms (post‐treatment and follow‐up), treatment completion, quality of life and adverse events. We evaluated the certainty of the estimates in the summary of findings tables using the GRADE approach \[[121](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-bib-0121 "GRADE Working Group.

Available from https://book.gradepro.org/."), [122](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-bib-0122 "GuyattGH , OxmanAD , VistGE , KunzR , Falck-YtterY , Alonso-CoelloP , et al; GRADE Working Group. GRADE: an emerging consensus on rating quality of evidence and strength of recommendations. BMJ (Clinical Research Ed.)2008;336(7650):924-6.")\]. We categorised the certainty of the evidence as high, moderate, low or very low, based on overall risk of bias, imprecision, inconsistency, indirectness and potential publication bias. Two review authors (JH, CH) independently assessed the certainty of the outcomes presented. In cases of disagreement, consensus was sought through discussion; if the disagreement was not resolved, a third review author (AC) provided arbitration.

The 73 trials recruited a total of at least 4985 participants at randomisation, and at least 3624 participants completed the trials. In two trials, data were not reported on the number of participants at randomisation or follow‐up (Reuter 1984; Wang 2022), while eight trials did not report participant numbers at follow‐up (Brenes 2007; Epstein 1986; Hess‐Homeier 1981; Khorvash 2012; Khoshnab 2017; Pinchasov 2000; Reuter 1984; Wang 2022).

We contacted the authors of three studies for additional data and received one response (Schuch 2015).

#### Excluded studies

In total, 326 studies have been excluded from the various versions of the review after full‐text review; the reasons for exclusion are listed below. As with previous updates, we decided not to list reviews as excluded studies. Further details of excluded studies can be found in [Supplementary material 3](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-supitem-0003).

In 195 studies, participants either did not have to have depression (as defined by the authors of the study) to be eligible for the study, had a condition that was excluded (e.g. dysthymia, bipolar, postnatal depression), or were a subgroup with another condition (e.g. people with obesity) (Abascal 2008 \[[280](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-bib-0280 "AbascalL .

Added to the nine studies that remain ongoing from the 2013 update by Cooney and colleagues (ACTRN12612000094875; CTR/2012/09/002985; NCT00931814; NCT01383811; NCT01464463; NCT01619930; NCT01696201; NCT01763983; UMIN000001488), there are currently 75 studies ongoing.

##### New studies found for this update

We are including 35 additional trials, which recruited a total of 2526 participants (where reported) at randomisation. One trial did not state the number of participants randomised (Wang 2022). Of these, 1844 participants (where reported) remained in the trials by the time of final outcome analysis (Abdelbasset 2019; Abdollahi 2017; Bademli 2023; Barclay 2014; Belvederi Murri 2015; Bose 2015; Brush 2022; Buschert 2019; Cheung 2018; De Groot 2019; Doose 2015; Eman 2017; Haller 2018; Heinzel 2022; Heissel 2015; Hidalgo 2021; Ho 2014; Huang 2015; Karg 2020; Khorvash 2012; Khoshnab 2017; Kruisdijk 2018; La Rocque 2021; Legrand 2014; Legrand 2016; Olson 2017; Pfaff 2014; Prakhinkit 2014; Roy 2018; Salehi 2016; Schuch 2015; Siqueira 2016; Taheri 2018; Wang 2022; Yu 2023). Three trials did not provide participant numbers at follow‐up (Khorvash 2012; Khoshnab 2017; Wang 2022). See [Supplementary material 2](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-supitem-0002).

### Risk of bias in included studies

#### Random sequence generation

We classified 30 trials as being at low risk of bias (Bademli 2023; Belvederi Murri 2015; Blumenthal 2007; Blumenthal 2012a; Brenes 2007; Brush 2022; Cheung 2018; De Groot 2019; Haller 2018; Heinzel 2022; Hidalgo 2021; Ho 2014; Hoffman 2010; Huang 2015; Karg 2020; Knubben 2007; Krogh 2009; La Rocque 2021; Legrand 2014; Legrand 2016; Martinsen 1985; Mather 2002; Olson 2017; Pfaff 2014; Prakhinkit 2014; Sims 2009; Singh 1997; Singh 2005; Siqueira 2016; Yu 2023), one as being at high risk of bias (Hemat‐Far 2012), and 42 trials as being at unclear risk of bias. A graphical representation of the risk of bias assessment can be seen in [Figure 2](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-fig-0002) and [Figure 3](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-fig-0003). See [Supplementary material 2](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-supitem-0002) for the full risk of bias assessment for each study.

#### Allocation concealment

Allocation concealment was adequate and therefore at low risk of bias in 22 trials (Blumenthal 1999; Blumenthal 2007; Blumenthal 2012a; Cheung 2018; De Groot 2019; Dunn 2005; Ho 2014; Hoffman 2010; Karg 2020; Knubben 2007; Krogh 2009; La Rocque 2021; Legrand 2016; Martinsen 1985; Mather 2002; Pfaff 2014; Sims 2009; Singh 1997; Singh 2005; Siqueira 2016; Veale 1992; Williams 2008). For the remaining trials, we judged the risk of bias as unclear or high (Abdelbasset 2019; Abdollahi 2017; Bademli 2023; Barclay 2014; Belvederi Murri 2015; Bonnet 2005; Bose 2015; Brenes 2007; Brush 2022; Buschert 2019; Chu 2008; Doose 2015; Doyne 1987; Eman 2017; Epstein 1986; Fetsch 1979; Foley 2008; Fremont 1987; Gary 2010; Greist 1979; Haller 2018; Heinzel 2022; Heissel 2015; Hemat‐Far 2012; Hess‐Homeier 1981; Hidalgo 2021; Huang 2015; Khorvash 2012; Khoshnab 2017; Klein 1985; Kruisdijk 2018; Legrand 2014; McCann 1984; McNeil 1991; Mota‐Pereira 2011; Mutrie 1988; Nabkasorn 2005; Olson 2017; Orth 1979; Pilu 2007; Pinchasov 2000; Prakhinkit 2014; Reuter 1984; Roy 2018; Salehi 2016; Schuch 2015; Setaro 1985; Shahidi 2011; Taheri 2018; Wang 2022; Yu 2023).

#### Blinding of participants

In exercise trials, participants cannot be blinded to the treatment allocation. We were advised by Cochrane Editors to classify all trials as being at high risk of bias.

#### Blinding of those delivering the intervention

Similarly, for those trials where supervised exercise was provided, the person delivering the intervention could not be blinded, so we were advised by the Cochrane Editors to classify all trials as being at high risk of bias (note that not all studies reported whether exercise was performed with or without supervision).

#### Blinding of outcome assessors

Twenty‐three trials included blinding of the outcome assessors, so we classified them as being at low risk of bias (Abdelbasset 2019; Belvederi Murri 2015; Blumenthal 1999; Blumenthal 2007; Blumenthal 2012a; Bose 2015; Brenes 2007; Cheung 2018; De Groot 2019; Dunn 2005; Gary 2010; Ho 2014; Huang 2015; Karg 2020; Knubben 2007; Krogh 2009; La Rocque 2021; Mather 2002; Mota‐Pereira 2011; Pfaff 2014; Singh 2005; Williams 2008; Yu 2023). We classified 19 trials as unclear (Abdollahi 2017; Bademli 2023; Barclay 2014; Buschert 2019; Eman 2017; Haller 2018; Heinzel 2022; Heissel 2015; Hidalgo 2021; Khorvash 2012; Kruisdijk 2018; Olson 2017; Pilu 2007; Pinchasov 2000; Roy 2018; Salehi 2016; Schuch 2015; Setaro 1985; Wang 2022) and 31 trials at high risk (Bonnet 2005; Brush 2022; Chu 2008; Doose 2015; Doyne 1987; Epstein 1986; Fetsch 1979; Foley 2008; Fremont 1987; Greist 1979; Hemat‐Far 2012; Hess‐Homeier 1981; Hoffman 2010; Khoshnab 2017; Klein 1985; Legrand 2014; Legrand 2016; Martinsen 1985; McCann 1984; McNeil 1991; Mutrie 1988; Nabkasorn 2005; Orth 1979; Prakhinkit 2014; Reuter 1984; Shahidi 2011; Sims 2009; Singh 1997; Siqueira 2016; Taheri 2018; Veale 1992).

#### Incomplete outcome data

We classified 31 trials as low risk of bias because they performed ‘intention‐to‐treat’ (ITT) analysis (i.e. complete outcome data were reported) or, if there were missing outcome data, these were replaced using a recognised statistical method (e.g. last observation carried forward), and participants remained in the group to which they had been allocated (Abdelbasset 2019; Bademli 2023; Barclay 2014; Belvederi Murri 2015; Blumenthal 1999; Blumenthal 2007; Blumenthal 2012a; Brush 2022; Cheung 2018; De Groot 2019; Doose 2015; Dunn 2005; Hidalgo 2021; Ho 2014; Hoffman 2010; Huang 2015; Karg 2020; Krogh 2009; La Rocque 2021; Legrand 2016; Mather 2002; McNeil 1991; Mota‐Pereira 2011; Mutrie 1988; Orth 1979; Pfaff 2014; Pilu 2007; Salehi 2016; Schuch 2015; Singh 1997; Siqueira 2016).

One trial reported data for individual participants (Orth 1979), so by using 'last observation carried forward', we replaced data from the participants who did not complete the trial and included these data in the meta‐analysis of ITT trials. One trial reported that the analysis was ITT, because it used a ‘worse‐case’ scenario assumption to replace data from participants who did not complete the trial, but they included only 38 of the 39 randomised participants in the analyses, so we classified it as ‘not ITT’ (Knubben 2007). The remaining studies were classified as being at unclear or high risk of bias. Most trials did not report data from participants who dropped out.

#### Selective reporting

We attempted to identify whether a protocol was available by screening the reference list of the publications. We identified protocols for eight trials and checked that all prespecified outcome events were reported, and rated these as being at low risk of bias (Barclay 2014; Blumenthal 2012a; Dunn 2005; Heinzel 2022; Karg 2020; Krogh 2009; La Rocque 2021; Yu 2023).

We classified 19 other trials as being at low risk of bias as we judged that there was sufficient information in the methods to be sure that the trials had reported all their planned outcomes (Belvederi Murri 2015; Blumenthal 1999; Blumenthal 2007; Cheung 2018; De Groot 2019; Doose 2015; Gary 2010; Hemat‐Far 2012; Hoffman 2010; Ho 2014; Huang 2015; Khoshnab 2017; Legrand 2014; Legrand 2016; Pfaff 2014; Prakhinkit 2014; Mota‐Pereira 2011; Shahidi 2011; Siqueira 2016).

We classified five trials at high risk of selective reporting bias. One trial did not have a methods section and only reported outcomes within the results (Greist 1979), while a second trial stated that there was an eight‐month interview follow‐up, but these data were not reported (Pilu 2007). A third trial did not report any measure of variation for all its outcome measures (Khorvash 2012). One trial did not report outcomes at follow‐up as was indicated it would do in the protocol (Hidalgo 2021). One trial reported data only for the intervention before and after its use rather than in comparison to the control intervention (Haller 2018).

#### Other biases

We considered seven trials to be at low risk of bias in terms of other potential biases (Bademli 2023; Brush 2022; Cheung 2018; Gary 2010; Karg 2020; Mota‐Pereira 2011; Siqueira 2016), with six trials at high risk of bias (Greist 1979; Haller 2018; Hemat‐Far 2012; Kruisdijk 2018; Taheri 2018; Wang 2022).

For 60 trials, the risk of bias was unclear (Abdelbasset 2019; Abdollahi 2017; Barclay 2014; Belvederi Murri 2015; Blumenthal 1999; Blumenthal 2007; Blumenthal 2012a; Bonnet 2005; Bose 2015; Brenes 2007; Buschert 2019; Chu 2008; De Groot 2019; Doose 2015; Doyne 1987; Dunn 2005; Eman 2017; Epstein 1986; Fetsch 1979; Foley 2008; Fremont 1987; Heinzel 2022; Heissel 2015; Hess‐Homeier 1981; Hidalgo 2021; Ho 2014; Hoffman 2010; Huang 2015; Khorvash 2012; Khoshnab 2017; Klein 1985; Knubben 2007; Krogh 2009; La Rocque 2021; Legrand 2014; Legrand 2016; Martinsen 1985; Mather 2002; McCann 1984; McNeil 1991; Mutrie 1988; Nabkasorn 2005; Olson 2017; Orth 1979; Pfaff 2014; Pilu 2007; Pinchasov 2000; Prakhinkit 2014; Reuter 1984; Roy 2018; Salehi 2016; Schuch 2015; Setaro 1985; Shahidi 2011; Sims 2009; Singh 1997; Singh 2005; Veale 1992; Williams 2008; Yu 2023).

On the basis of the first 50 participants, one study changed the sample size calculation based on the observed standard deviation (Krogh 2009; their initial calculation was that a minimum of 186 participants (standard deviation (SD) = 6) were needed, but for the first 50 participants, the SD was 3.9, so they adjusted their sample size calculation to 135 participants). Hemat‐Far 2012 told the control group to reduce their activity.

We decided to include data on continuous depression scores in our meta‐analysis, rather than depression measured as a dichotomous outcome. This is because we knew from previous updates that very few trials had reported depression as a dichotomous outcome, and we wished to include as many trials as possible in our meta‐analysis. For future updates, we will consider whether to perform a separate meta‐analysis for trials that measured depression as a dichotomous outcome.

#### Publication bias

Visually, our funnel plot appeared to suggest some missing studies that may be due to a degree of publication bias, outcome reporting bias or heterogeneity (Egger regression intercept P value was 0.00265) \[[689](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-bib-0689 "EggerM , Davey SmithG , MinderC . Bias in meta-analysis detected by a simple, graphical test. BMJ (Clinical Research Ed.)1997;315(7109):629-34.")\] (funnel plot for exercise versus control ‐ analysis 1.1 ([Figure 4](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-fig-0004))). Use of Duval and Tweedie's trim and fill suggests that 15 studies may have been trimmed from the right of the mean (i.e. small studies favouring control intervention), and the adjusted SMD was −0.45 (95% CI −0.62 to −0.28), representing a moderate benefit from exercise \[[690](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-bib-0690 "DuvalS , TweedieR .

### Synthesis of results

#### Comparison I: exercise versus control

Sixty‐one trials (2576 participants) included a comparison of exercise with a control intervention, although only 57 trials (2189 participants) reported data that could be meta‐analysed (see [Supplementary material 5](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-supitem-0005)).

##### Primary outcome measure

###### 1.1 Reduction in depressive symptom severity

**Post‐treatment**

The pooled standardised mean difference (SMD) for the 57 trials (2189 participants), which was calculated using a random‐effects model, was −0.67 (95% CI −0.82 to −0.52; I² = 61, P < 0.001; GRADE: low), showing that exercise may result in a reduction in depressive symptoms (Analysis 1.1 in [Supplementary material 5](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-supitem-0005) and [Figure 5](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-fig-0005)).

**End of long‐term follow‐up**

We were able to pool nine trials (405 participants) that provided long‐term follow‐up data, ranging from 8 weeks to 12 months of follow‐up (Blumenthal 1999; Fremont 1987; Gary 2010; Heinzel 2022; Huang 2015; Klein 1985; Krogh 2009; Sims 2009; Wang 2022). The pooled SMD (random‐effects) showed that the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of exercise on depressive symptoms (SMD −0.53, 95% CI −1.11 to 0.06; I² = 87, P < 0.001; GRADE: very low) (Analysis 1.2; [Figure 6](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-fig-0006)). Follow‐up data from Blumenthal 2007 were reported according to the proportion who had fully or partially remitted from depression, but continuous mood scores were not reported, so we could not include these data in the meta‐analysis.

##### Secondary outcome measures

###### 1.2a Acceptability of treatment: attendance at exercise

Twenty‐six trials reported attendance rates for exercise. These were 50.6% for aerobic and 56.2% for strength exercise groups (Krogh 2009), 58% (Doose 2015; Pfaff 2014), 66.9% for exercise and 68.8% for yoga (La Rocque 2021), 68% (Legrand 2014), 70% (Doyne 1987), 72% (Dunn 2005), 73% (Ho 2014), 75% for progressive aerobic plus sertraline and 71% for non‐progressive exercise plus sertraline (Belvederi Murri 2015), 78% (Nabkasorn 2005), 82% (Gary 2010), 84% for endurance and 90% for strength exercise (Haller 2018), 91% (Mota‐Pereira 2011; Schuch 2015), 92% (Blumenthal 1999; Blumenthal 2007), 92.7% for moderate and 95% for vigorous exercise (Yu 2023), 92.9% and 81.8% attended ≥ 8 sessions, respectively (Legrand 2016), 94% (Blumenthal 2012a), 97.3% for high‐intensity and 99.1% for low‐intensity (Chu 2008), 95% to 100% (Singh 2005) and 100% (Huang 2015). One trial reported the mean number of exercise sessions attended as 5.88 (Hoffman 2010). Another trial reported that 1.71 and 1.60 exercise sessions were attended for high‐ and low‐intensity exercise, respectively (Heinzel 2022). One trial rescheduled missed visits (McNeil 1991) so participants attended the full course of exercise. One trial reported high adherence (no data reported) (Heissel 2015). As with exercise intensity, it is difficult to attribute any differences in outcome to differences in attendance rates because there were other sources of variation in the type of interventions (e.g. duration of intervention, type of exercise) and differences in the risk of bias between trials that might account for differences in outcome.

###### 1.2b Acceptability of treatment: completing the intervention or control

We extracted data on the number of participants who were randomised in each trial and the number who completed each trial ([Table 1](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-tbl-0005)). This ranged from 100% completion (Bademli 2023; Barclay 2014; Hemat‐Far 2012; Huang 2015; Khoshnab 2017; McNeil 1991; Mutrie 1988; Orth 1979; Pilu 2007; Salehi 2016; Siqueira 2016; Taheri 2018) to 46% completion (Hidalgo 2021). For the exercise intervention, this ranged from 100% completion (Bademli 2023; Barclay 2014; Cheung 2018; Doose 2015; Gary 2010; Hemat‐Far 2012; Huang 2015; Khoshnab 2017; McNeil 1991; Mutrie 1988; Orth 1979; Pilu 2007; Salehi 2016; Siqueira 2016; Taheri 2018) to 38% completion (Hidalgo 2021). Fifty‐one studies (2311 participants) reported how many participants completed the exercise and control arms (Analysis 1.3; [Figure 7](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-fig-0007)), producing a risk ratio of (RR) 1.0 (95% CI 0.98 to 1.02; GRADE: moderate certainty), showing that exercise results in little or no difference in completion compared to control.

###### 1.3 Quality of life

Seven studies reported measures of quality of life at the end of the study (Brenes 2007; Gary 2010; Huang 2015; Pilu 2007; Schuch 2015; Sims 2009; Singh 2005), comparing interventions on different domains of quality‐of‐life questionnaires (Analysis 1.4 in [Supplementary material 5](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-supitem-0005)). One trial reported changes in quality of life without presenting the necessary data to include in the meta‐analysis (Singh 2005), and another reported quality of life at baseline but not at follow‐up (Sims 2009).

The evidence was very uncertain for the quality of life mental health domain (SMD −0.05, 95% CI −0.85 to 0.76; I² = 74%, P = 0.02; 3 studies, 98 participants; GRADE: very low) and psychological domain (SMD 0.35, 95% CI −1.22 to 1.92; I² = 90%, P = 0.001; 2 studies, 80 participants; GRADE: very low). For social domains, exercise may result in little to no difference following exercise compared to control (SMD 0.37, 95% CI −0.18 to 0.92; I² = 29%, P = 0.24; 2 studies, 80 participants; GRADE: low). In contrast, exercise may result in an increase in the environment domain (SMD 0.51, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.96; I² = 0%, P = 0.82; 2 studies, 80 participants; GRADE: low) and physical domain (SMD 0.57, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.98; I² = 44%, P = 0.13; 5 studies, 178 participants; GRADE: very low) of quality of life, although the evidence is very uncertain for the physical domain. One study (39 participants) reported on a quality of life domain, where the evidence on the effect of exercise on quality of life was very uncertain (SMD 0.56, 95% CI −0.08 to 1.20; GRADE: very low).

**1.4 Cost**

No trial reported the cost or cost‐effectiveness of exercise compared to another intervention.

###### 1.5 Adverse events

Eleven trials reported data on adverse events between the exercise and the control groups (Belvederi Murri 2015; Blumenthal 1999; Blumenthal 2007; Blumenthal 2012a; Doose 2015; Dunn 2005; Knubben 2007; Legrand 2016; Prakhinkit 2014; Sims 2009; Singh 2005), showing that exercise is likely to result in little to no difference in adverse events compared to control. Dunn 2005 reported increased severity of depressive symptoms (n = 1), chest pain (n = 1) and joint pain/swelling (n = 1); all of these participants discontinued exercise. Singh 2005 reported adverse events in detail (visits to a health professional, minor illness, muscular pain, chest pain, injuries requiring training adjustment, falls, deaths and hospital days) and found no difference between the groups. Knubben 2007 reported “no negative effects of exercise (muscle pain, tightness or fatigue)” in the course of the programme; two weeks after the training had finished, one person in the placebo group required gastric lavage and one person in the exercise group inflicted a superficial cut in her arm. Sims 2009 reported no adverse events or falls in either the exercise or control groups. Blumenthal 1999 reported that five participants in the exercise plus sertraline group dropped out due to adverse events associated with sertraline and four participants due to musculoskeletal injury. Five participants from the sertraline‐only group dropped out owing to medication adverse events (Blumenthal 1999). Blumenthal 2007 reported side effects using a participant rating of a 36‐item checklist, with the only statistically significant difference (P = 0.03) reported for participants experiencing post‐treatment diarrhoea and loose stools (sertraline 31%; home‐based exercise 21%; supervised exercise 10%; placebo 12%). Blumenthal 2012a reported more fatigue and sexual dysfunction in the sertraline group (20% and 26%, respectively) than in the exercise group (2.4% for both side effects). Although Prakhinkit 2014 reported that five participants withdrew either due to loss to follow‐up, physical discomfort or lack of compliance, no details were provided regarding which interventions they received. Belvederi Murri 2015 reported two participants engaged with physical exercise plus sertraline left the study, one due to having ankle distortion and another through worsening musculoskeletal pain. Doose 2015 found that seven participants in the exercise group reported adverse events, including three who were unable to continue due to worsening of pre‐existing orthopaedic injuries, two who were admitted to psychiatric wards with major depression and two who withdrew for personal reasons. Four in the control group also reported adverse events: one was admitted to hospital, one felt physically incapable of participating, one did not want to participate due to worsened pre‐existing chronic neck pain and one withdrew for personal reasons (Doose 2015). Adverse events were reported in the exercise intervention group by Legrand 2016, including transient muscular/joint soreness (n = 3), headaches (n = 1) and fatigue (n = 2). Due to the diversity of different adverse events reported, we decided not to meta‐analyse these data.

#### Comparison 2: exercise versus psychological therapies

Eleven trials (918 participants) compared exercise with psychological therapies (De Groot 2019; Epstein 1986; Fetsch 1979; Fremont 1987; Gary 2010; Greist 1979; Hess‐Homeier 1981; Huang 2015; Karg 2020; Klein 1985; Setaro 1985).

##### Primary outcome

###### 2.1 Reduction in depressive symptom severity

**Post‐treatment**

We included data from 10 trials (414 participants) comparing exercise with psychological therapies in a meta‐analysis (De Groot 2019; Epstein 1986; Fetsch 1979; Fremont 1987; Gary 2010; Hess‐Homeier 1981; Huang 2015; Karg 2020; Klein 1985; Setaro 1985). When data were pooled, the SMD was 0.03 (95% CI −0.16 to 0.23), showing that exercise results in little to no difference compared to psychological therapies in changing depressive symptoms (Analysis 2.1 in [Supplementary material 5](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-supitem-0005)). The analysis provides moderate‐certainty evidence, with heterogeneity that was considered unimportant (I² = 0%, P = 0.85).

**End of long‐term follow‐up**

Long‐term follow‐up was reported by four studies (114 participants) ranging from 4 to 9 months (Fremont 1987; Gary 2010; Huang 2015; Klein 1985), which we judged as low‐certainty evidence. When pooled in a random‐effects meta‐analysis (Analysis 2.2 in [Supplementary material 5](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-supitem-0005)), the SMD of −0.11 (95% CI ‐0.48 to 0.26) showed that exercise may result in little to no difference compared to psychological therapies in changing depressive symptoms. No statistical heterogeneity was found (I² = 0%, P = 0.47).

##### Secondary outcomes

###### 2.2a Acceptability of treatment: attendance at exercise sessions

Two trials reported attendance rates (Gary 2010; Huang 2015). One trial reported adherence scores that were calculated based on the number of sessions attended of those prescribed. This trial reported that the adherence rates were 82% for exercise and 72% for CBT (Gary 2010). A second trial reported that the exercise group achieved 100% at 3‐month follow‐up, declining to 47% at 6‐ and 9‐month follow‐up (Huang 2015). Adherence rates for CBT were not reported (Huang 2015).

###### 2.2b Acceptability of treatment: completing the intervention or psychological therapies

Seven trials (433 participants) reported the number of participants completing either the intervention trial or psychological therapies (Analysis 2.3 in [Supplementary material 5](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-supitem-0005)) (De Groot 2019; Fetsch 1979; Fremont 1987; Gary 2010; Huang 2015; Karg 2020; Klein 1985). The risk ratio for treatment acceptability was 1.06 (95% CI 0.99 to 1.13; GRADE: moderate), showing that exercise probably results in little to no difference in completion of the intervention compared to psychological therapies.

###### 2.3. Quality of life

Two trials (72 participants) reported changes in quality of life measures, specifically the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (Gary 2010) and the SF‐36 (Huang 2015) (Analysis 2.4 in [Supplementary material 5](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-supitem-0005)).

When pooled through meta‐analysis, it was shown that exercise may result in a slight increase in the physical domain of quality of life compared to psychological therapy (SMD 0.25, 95% CI −0.21 to 0.72; GRADE: low). In contrast, there was little to no difference between exercise and psychological therapies for the mental domain (SMD 0.05, 95% CI −0.41 to 0.52; GRADE: low). No statistical heterogeneity was evident for either physical (I² = 0%, P = 0.32) or mental (I² = 0%, P = 0.81) domains. Only one trial (37 participants) reported a summary quality of life score (Huang 2015), finding that exercise may result in a slight increase in quality of life compared to psychological therapy, although the evidence was very uncertain (SMD 0.37, 95% CI −0.28 to 1.02; GRADE: very low).

###### 2.4 Cost

No trial reported the cost or cost‐effectiveness of exercise compared to another intervention.

###### 2.5 Adverse events

One trial by Karg 2020 reported that eight participants dropped out of the exercise intervention group, with one participant reporting physical complaints. Although 12 participants dropped out of the comparator group (CBT), none were identified as an adverse event associated with the comparator intervention (versus CBT).

#### Comparison 3: exercise versus pharmacological treatments

Six trials (677 participants) assessed the effectiveness of exercise compared to pharmacological treatments (Blumenthal 1999; Blumenthal 2007; Blumenthal 2012a; Brenes 2007; Hidalgo 2021; Khoshnab 2017).

##### Primary outcome

###### 3.1 Reduction in depressive symptom severity

**Post‐treatment**

For the five trials (330 participants) that compared exercise with pharmacological treatments (Blumenthal 1999; Blumenthal 2007; Blumenthal 2012a; Brenes 2007; Khoshnab 2017) the SMD was −0.11 (95% CI −0.33 to 0.10) (Analysis 3.1 in [Supplementary material 5](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-supitem-0005)), indicating that exercise results in little to difference in depressive symptoms compared to pharmacological treatments. No statistical heterogeneity was indicated (I² = 0%, P = 0.69).

**End of long‐term follow‐up**

One study (58 participants) reported long‐term follow‐up at 6 months (Blumenthal 1999), suggesting that exercise may result in a slight reduction in depressive symptoms compared to pharmacological treatment, although the evidence is very uncertain (MD ‐0.40, 95% CI −0.80 to 0.00) (Analysis 3.2 in [Supplementary material 5](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-supitem-0005)).

##### Secondary outcomes

###### 3.2a Acceptability of treatment: attendance at exercise

Four trials reported on attendance rates (Blumenthal 1999; Blumenthal 2007; Blumenthal 2012a; Hidalgo 2021). Three trials reported attendance rates as 82% (Blumenthal 2007), 89.6% (Blumenthal 1999) and 94% (Blumenthal 2012a) for participants receiving exercise alone. Adherence to pharmacological treatment differed among the trials, ranging from 83% (Blumenthal 2007) to 100% achieving acceptable adherence (Blumenthal 1999; Blumenthal 2012a). A fourth trial reported that the mean number of sessions of physical activity attended was 18.9 (Hidalgo 2021).

###### 3.2b Acceptability of treatment: completing the intervention or pharmacological intervention

For participant completion of the trial, there were data from five trials (655 participants) (Blumenthal 1999; Blumenthal 2007; Blumenthal 2012a; Hidalgo 2021; Khoshnab 2017). The risk ratio was 0.92 (95% CI 0.77 to 1.10; GRADE: low) (Analysis 3.3 in [Supplementary material 5](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-supitem-0005)).

###### 3.3. Quality of life

One trial (25 participants) by Brenes 2007 showed that the evidence is very uncertain about the benefits of exercise compared to pharmacological treatments on the SF‐36 mental health domain (MD ‐11.90, 95% CI −24.04 to 0.24; GRADE: very low) and physical health domain (MD 1.30, 95% CI −0.67 to 3.27; GRADE: very low) (Analysis 3.4 in [Supplementary material 5](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-supitem-0005)).

###### 3.4 Cost

No trial reported the cost or cost‐effectiveness of exercise compared to another intervention.

###### 3.5 Adverse events

Blumenthal 1999 reported that three of 53 participants in the exercise group suffered musculoskeletal injuries; five participants from the medication group experienced medication adverse events. Blumenthal 2007 collected data on side effects by asking participants to rate a 36‐item somatic symptom checklist and reported that “a few patients reported worsening of symptoms”. Of the 36 side effects assessed, only one showed a statistically significant group difference (P = 0.03), with the sertraline group reporting worse post‐treatment diarrhoea and loose stools (31%) compared to home‐based exercise (21%) and supervised exercise (10%). Blumenthal 2012a also assessed the 36 side effects following the approach by Blumenthal 2007. Only two side effects differed significantly between the groups, with the sertraline group having worse post‐treatment fatigue (20%) and increased sexual problems (26%) than the exercise group (2.4% for both side effects). Hidalgo 2021 reported that 8.9% of people undertaking the exercise intervention reported adverse events, including osteomuscular pain, mild contusions or dizziness. In the comparator group receiving antidepressant therapy, 22.5% reported adverse events, including dizziness (6.5%), epigastric pain (5.2%) or daytime drowsiness (3.2%) (Hidalgo 2021). The evidence indicates that exercise may result in fewer adverse events than pharmacological treatments.

#### Comparison 4: exercise versus 'other' comparators

Nine studies (365 participants) compared exercise with one of five other comparator interventions, which were bright light therapy (Pinchasov 2000), reflexology (Eman 2017), occupational or art therapy (Buschert 2019; Martinsen 1985), supplements (Taheri 2018) and health education (Abdelbasset 2019; Bose 2015; Mather 2002; Singh 1997).

##### Primary outcome

###### 4.1 Reduction in depressive symptom severity

**Post‐treatment**

Separate studies comparing exercise to bright light therapy (SMD −1.48, 95% CI −2.56 to −0.41; 18 participants) (Pinchasov 2000), reflexology (SMD −1.32, 95% CI −2.01 to −0.63; 40 participants) (Eman 2017) and supplements (SMD −1.41, 95% CI −2.54 to −0.28; 16 participants) (Taheri 2018) found that exercise may be more effective than the different comparators (Analysis 4.1 in [Supplementary material 5](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-supitem-0005)). Also, exercise may be more effective than health education (SMD −1.16, 95% CI −1.99 to −0.33; 218 participants), although there was considerable statistical heterogeneity (I² = 87%, P < 0.001) (Abdelbasset 2019; Bose 2015; Mather 2002; Singh 1997). For the two trials (73 participants) that compared exercise with occupational or art therapy (Buschert 2019; Martinsen 1985), the SMD was −0.51 (95% CI −1.75 to 0.73), with considerable statistical heterogeneity (I² = 85%, P = 0.01), indicating that there may be little difference between the two interventions. In all comparisons, the limited evidence makes the findings very uncertain.

**End of long‐term follow‐up**

Three studies (170 participants) reported long‐term follow‐up for the comparison of exercise with health education ranging from 8 weeks to 26 months (Bose 2015; Mather 2002; Singh 1997), reporting that exercise may provide a comparative benefit (SMD −1.22, 95% CI −2.63 to 0.19; I² = 93%, P < 0.001) (Analysis 4.2 in [Supplementary material 5](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-supitem-0005)). No studies reported long‐term follow‐up in comparisons with bright light therapy, reflexology, occupational or art therapy, or supplements.

##### Secondary outcomes

###### 4.2a Acceptability of treatment: attendance at exercise

None of the trials of bright light therapy, reflexology, occupational or art therapy, or supplements reported this outcome. Two of the four trials assessing health education reported attendance rates, varying from 59% for aerobic exercise (Mather 2002) to 93% for high‐intensity exercise (Singh 1997).

###### 4.2b Acceptability of treatment: completing the intervention or control

All participants in the trials comparing exercise with reflexology (Eman 2017) and with supplements (Taheri 2018) completed the trial. The trial of bright light therapy did not report on this outcome (Pinchasov 2000). Two trials of occupational or art therapy reported on the acceptability of treatment (Buschert 2019; Martinsen 1985), with a risk ratio of 0.99 (95% CI 0.82 to 1.20) (Analysis 4.3 in [Supplementary material 5](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-supitem-0005)). All four trials comparing exercise with health education reported the number of participants randomised and completing the trial (Abdelbasset 2019; Bose 2015; Mather 2002; Singh 1997), reporting a risk ratio of 1.01 (95% CI 0.96 to 1.05) (Analysis 4.3 in [Supplementary material 5](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-supitem-0005)).

###### 4.3. Quality of life

None of the trials reported on this outcome.

###### 4.4 Cost

No trial reported the cost or cost‐effectiveness of exercise compared to another intervention.

###### 4.5 Adverse events

Only the trial by Singh 1997 comparing exercise with health education reported on adverse events, with one participant undertaking exercise being referred to a psychologist at six weeks due to increasing suicidality, and musculoskeletal symptoms in two participants necessitated adjustment of the training regime.

#### Subgroup analysis for reduction in depressive symptom severity

##### Type of exercise

We explored the influence of the type of exercise (aerobic, mixed or resistance) on outcomes for those trials comparing exercise versus control (Analysis 5.1 in [Supplementary material 5](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-supitem-0005)). All types of exercise appeared beneficial compared to control, with no evidence of a difference between the subgroups (P = 0.60). Forty‐eight studies (1937 participants) assessing aerobic exercise found a moderate to large benefit from exercise (SMD −0.64, 95% CI −0.80 to −0.48), although there was substantial heterogeneity (I² = 62%, P < 0.001). Mixed exercise was assessed by six studies (139 participants), which when pooled showed a large clinical effect from exercise compared to control (SMD −0.92, 95% CI −1.66 to −0.17), with substantial heterogeneity (I² = 73%, P = 0.002). The three studies (112 participants) of resistance exercise appear to show a comparative benefit from exercise (SMD −0.80, 95% CI −1.20 to −0.41), although confidence intervals were fairly wide. The effects of heterogeneity were considered not to be important (I² = 0%, P = 0.48).

##### Intensity and sessions of exercise

We explored the influence of intensity of exercise (very light, light, moderate, vigorous, near maximum to maximum) on the reduction of depression for those trials comparing exercise versus control (Analysis 5.2 in [Supplementary material 5](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-supitem-0005)), finding that there was no difference between the subgroups (P = 0.72). Fifty‐seven studies making 59 different comparisons at four different levels of intensity (i.e. very light, light, moderate, vigorous), were included in the analyses. One study employed very light intensity exercise, finding limited difference between exercise and control (SMD −0.31, 95% CI −1.13 to 0.50). Eight studies (357 participants) carried out light‐intensity exercise, which had a moderate clinical effect (SMD −0.66, 95% CI −0.94 to −0.38), with heterogeneity we considered to be moderate (I² = 32%, P = 0.17). Thirty‐one studies (1020 participants) carried out moderate‐intensity exercise resulting in a moderate to large clinical effect (SMD −0.71, 95% CI −0.92 to −0.49); however, the analysis was affected by moderate to substantial heterogeneity (I² = 59%, P < 0.001). In the 19 studies (819 participants) that carried out vigorous intensity exercise, there was a moderate effect (SMD −0.57, 95% CI −0.82 to −0.31), with substantial heterogeneity (I² = 65%, P < 0.001).

We explored the influence of the total number of prescribed exercise sessions (0 to 12, 13 to 24, 25 to 36, 37+ sessions) on the reduction in depressive symptoms for those trials comparing exercise versus control (Analysis 5.3 in [Supplementary material 5](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-supitem-0005)). Although exercise provided greater benefit compared to the control interventions, the extent of the difference in effect did not vary significantly between the subgroups (P = 0.32). Ten studies (373 participants) providing up to 12 sessions of exercise found a moderate beneficial effect compared to control (SMD −0.52, 95% CI −1.09 to 0.04), with the meta‐analysis affected by substantial statistically significant heterogeneity (I² = 84%, P < 0.001). Increasing the number of sessions to between 13 and 36 sessions increased the benefit from exercise when compared to control. In the 20 studies (741 participants) where participants received 13 to 24 sessions (SMD −0.76, 95% CI −0.96 to −0.56) and the 11 studies (363 participants) where participants received 25 to 36 sessions (SMD −0.72, 95% CI −1.14 to −0.30), there appeared to be large benefits from exercise compared to control. In both cases, the meta‐analyses were affected by heterogeneity, although this was moderate for 13 to 24 sessions (I² =39%, P = 0.04) and substantial for 25 to 36 sessions (I² = 72%, P < 0.001). People receiving 37 or more sessions were assessed in 12 studies (559 participants), and a moderate benefit from exercise compared to control was found (SMD −0.48, 95% CI −0.68 to −0.27), with levels of heterogeneity that we considered unimportant (I² = 25%, P = 0.20). In four studies (152 participants), the number of sessions provided was unclear. When these four studies were pooled, benefit was found from exercise compared to control (SMD −0.77, 95% CI −1.11 to −0.44), with unimportant levels of heterogeneity (I² = 0%, P = 0.88).

##### Type of diagnosis

We performed subgroup analyses according to how the diagnosis of depression was made, whether it was a clinical diagnosis or categorised according to cut points on a scale or where it was unclear (Analysis 5.4 in [Supplementary material 5](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-supitem-0005)). We found that there was no difference between the subgroups (P = 0.72). In the meta‐analysis of the 35 trials (1449 participants) where depression was diagnosed clinically, a moderate‐to‐large benefit was found for exercise versus control (SMD −0.63, 95% CI −0.81 to −0.44), although the analysis was affected by substantial heterogeneity (I² = 62%, P ˂ 0.001). Where trials used cut‐points on a scale (18 trials, 616 participants), the pooled effect showed a moderate‐to‐large benefit favouring exercise relative to control (SMD −0.73, 95% CI −0.97 to −0.49); the meta‐analysis was characterised by moderate heterogeneity (I² = 48%, P = 0.01). The method of diagnosis was unclear in four trials (123 participants). When pooled, the four trials showed uncertain effect (SMD −0.88, 95% CI −1.88 to 0.12), with the analysis affected by considerable heterogeneity (I² = 84%, P < 0.001).

##### Type of control

We categorised the type of control as either: placebo; no treatment, waiting list, usual care or self‐monitoring; exercise plus treatment versus treatment alone; stretching, meditation or relaxation; or, social/casual conversation (Analysis 5.5 in [Supplementary material 5](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-supitem-0005)). In the previous update, the categorisations were made by one author (KD) on the basis of data extracted at the initial stage of data extraction, and were checked by a second author (GM). In the current update, all the additional studies were classified by JH, AC, DM, CH, CS, CL. Although exercise was beneficial in reducing depressive symptoms compared to each of the different types of control, the difference between the subgroups was not significant (P = 0.13). When compared with the 'no treatment, waiting list, usual care or self‐monitoring' comparator in 27 studies (897 participants), it was shown that exercise may result in a large reduction in depressive symptoms (SMD −0.85, 95% CI −1.06 to −0.64; GRADE: low), with the meta‐analysis affected by heterogeneity that we considered moderate (I² = 51%, P = 0.001). The meta‐analyses of 19 studies (812 participants) comparing exercise plus treatment versus treatment only (SMD −0.57, 95% CI −0.83 to −0.30; GRADE: very low) and the 11 studies (385 participants) comparing exercise with stretching, meditation or relaxation (SMD −0.48, 95% CI −0.80 to −0.15; GRADE: very low) found that exercise may result in a reduction in depressive symptoms, but the evidence is very uncertain. In both instances, the meta‐analyses were affected by moderate to substantial heterogeneity (exercise plus treatment with treatment only I² = 68%, P < 0.001; exercise with stretching, meditation or relaxation I² = 54%, P = 0.02). Comparison of exercise with 'social/casual conversation' in one study (29 participants) (SMD −0.48, 95% CI −1.23 to 0.27; GRADE: very low) and with 'placebo' in three studies (172 participants) (SMD −0.21, 95% CI −0.81 to 0.40; GRADE: very low) showed that exercise may result in a reduction in depressive symptoms, but the evidence is very uncertain, with the comparison with placebo affected by substantial heterogeneity (I² = 66%, P = 0.05). We considered whether to perform additional subgroup analyses according to supervised versus unsupervised exercise, indoor versus outdoor exercise and individual versus group exercise, and according to the type of control group (in the no‐treatment comparison), but we wanted to focus on the main subgroups of interest. Multiple subgroup analyses are generally considered inadvisable.

#### Sensitivity analysis

We conducted sensitivity analyses to explore the impact of study quality factors on the pooled effect size, comparing findings with the outcome from the meta‐analysis of all 57 studies (Analysis 1.1 in [Supplementary material 5](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-supitem-0005)). The characteristics of interest included the type of publication, allocation concealment, use of intention‐to‐treat analysis and blinding of outcomes assessment.

##### Peer‐reviewed journal publications

For the 56 trials (2169 participants) that were reported in peer‐reviewed journal publications or doctoral theses, the SMD was −0.65 (95% CI −0.80 to −0.51), showing a moderate clinical effect in favour of exercise, with substantial heterogeneity (I² = 60%, P < 0.001) (Analysis 6.1 in [Supplementary material 5](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-supitem-0005)).

##### Published as abstracts/conference proceedings only

Only one study (18 participants) was published as a conference abstract. It showed benefit from exercise (MD −13.46, 95% CI −19.37 to −7.55) (Analysis 6.2 in [Supplementary material 5](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-supitem-0005)).

##### Allocation concealment

For the 17 trials (916 participants) with adequate allocation concealment and therefore at low risk of bias, the SMD was −0.51 (95% CI −0.72 to −0.30) (Analysis 6.3 in [Supplementary material 5](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-supitem-0005)), showing a moderate clinical effect in favour of exercise. Although this did not show a large difference from the pooled SMD for all 57 trials of exercise versus control (SMD −0.67, 95% CI −0.82 to −0.52) (Analysis 1.1 in [Supplementary material 5](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-supitem-0005)), it was lower. The meta‐analysis of the 17 trials with adequate concealment was affected by substantial heterogeneity (I² = 57%, P = 0.002).

##### Use of intention‐to‐treat analysis

For the 21 trials (994 participants) undertaking an intention‐to‐treat analysis, the pooled SMD of −0.77 (95% CI −1.05 to −0.50) showed some benefit in favour of exercise (Analysis 6.4 in [Supplementary material 5](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-supitem-0005)), which was larger than that shown in the analysis of all 57 trials (Analysis 1.1 in [Supplementary material 5](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-supitem-0005)). Again, the meta‐analysis was affected by substantial heterogeneity (I² = 74%, P < 0.001).

##### Blinded outcome assessment

For the 21 trials (998 participants) with blinded outcome assessments, the SMD was −0.53 (95% CI −0.73 to −0.33) (Analysis 6.5 in [Supplementary material 5](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-supitem-0005)), showing a moderate effect in favour of exercise. The SMD was smaller than the pooled SMD for all 57 trials. It was affected by a substantial level of heterogeneity (I² = 54%, P = 0.002).

##### Allocation concealment, intention‐to‐treat analysis and blinded outcome assessment

For the seven trials (447 participants) with adequate allocation concealment and intention‐to‐treat analysis and blinded outcome assessment, and therefore at low risk of bias, the SMD was −0.46 (95% CI −0.88 to −0.04) (Analysis 6.6 in [Supplementary material 5](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-supitem-0005)), with substantial heterogeneity (I² = 78%, P < 0.001). This moderate effect in favour of exercise was smaller than that shown in the pooled SMD for all 57 trials (Analysis 1.1 in [Supplementary material 5](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-supitem-0005): SMD −0.67, 95% CI −0.82 to −0.52).

##### Lowest dose

We assessed the effects of the dose of exercise on the outcome of reduction in depressive symptoms. Where trials included multiple arms with different doses, we included the arm with the lowest dose of exercise.

Thirteen trials included more than one dose of exercise (Belvederi Murri 2015; Blumenthal 2007; Chu 2008; Doyne 1987; Dunn 2005; Heinzel 2022; Krogh 2009; Mutrie 1988; Orth 1979; Setaro 1985; Singh 2005; Williams 2008; Yu 2023), with the largest dose replaced with the lowest dose for this sensitivity analysis (Analysis 6.7; [Figure 8](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-fig-0008); [Supplementary material 5](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-supitem-0005)). The effect was to slightly reduce the SMD from −0.67 (95% CI −0.82 to −0.52) to −0.60 (95% CI −0.74 to −0.46), showing a similar moderate benefit from exercise. The analysis was affected by moderate heterogeneity (I² = 55%, P < 0.001). It is likely that this reflects the limited number of studies in which a lower dose was compared, as well as the difference in the type of exercise and extent of difference in the dose.

##### Recruitment and retention of participants

[Table 1](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-tbl-0005) presents data about the feasibility of recruiting and retaining participants both in the trial as a whole and in the exercise intervention in particular. We extracted data, when available, about the number of participants who were considered for inclusion in each trial, although this information was not available for all trials. The trials that did provide these data used different recruitment techniques (ranging from screening of people responding to advertisements to inclusion of those patients who were considered eligible by a referring doctor).

#### Equity assessment

We did not undertake a formal equity assessment.

#### Reporting biases

A degree of publication bias was thought to be evident from a visual inspection of the funnel plot (Egger regression intercept P = 0.00365) \[[689](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/#CD004366-bib-0689 "EggerM , Davey SmithG , MinderC .
