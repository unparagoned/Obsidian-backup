## Abstract

**Objective:** Sleep restriction alters daytime cardiac activity, including elevating heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP). There is minimal research on the cumulative effects of sleep loss and the response after subsequent recovery sleep on HR and BP. This study examined patterns of HR and BP across baseline, sleep restriction, and recovery conditions using multiple daytime cardiac measurements.

**Methods:** Participants (15 healthy men, mean \[standard deviation\] = 22.3 \[2.8\] years) completed an 11-day inpatient protocol with three nights of 10 hours/night baseline sleep opportunity, five sleep restriction nights (5-hour/night sleep opportunity), and two recovery nights (10-hour/night sleep opportunity). Resting HR and BP were measured every 2 hours during wake. Multilevel models with random effects for individuals examined daytime HR and BP across study conditions and days into the study.

**Results:** Mean daytime HR was 1.2 (0.5) beats/min lower during sleep restriction compared with baseline ( p <.001). During recovery, HR was 5.5 (1.0) beats/min higher ( p <.001), and systolic BP (SBP) was 2.9 (1.1) mm Hg higher ( p =.009). When accounting for days into the study (irrespective of condition) and measurement timing across the day, HR increased by 7.6 beats/min and SBP increased by 3.4 mm Hg across the study period ( p <.001).

**Conclusions:** Our findings suggest that daytime HR and SBP increase after successive nights of sleep restriction, even after accounting for measurement time of day. HR and SBP did not recover to baseline levels after two recovery nights of sleep, suggesting that longer recovery sleep may be necessary to recover from multiple, consecutive nights of moderate sleep restriction.

## Conflict of interest statement

This project was supported by a grant (PI: Dr. Chang) from the Pennsylvania State University Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute (funded by the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, National Institutes of Health, through Grant UL1TR002014) and institutional funds from the College of Health and Human Development of the Pennsylvania State University to Drs. Chang and Buxton. The content is solely the responsibility of the authors and does not necessarily represent the official views of the NIH or the Pennsylvania State University. Outside of the current work, Orfeu M. Buxton discloses that, in the last 3 years, he received subcontract grants to Penn State from Proactive Life LLC (formerly Mobile Sleep Technologies) doing business as SleepSpace (NSF/STTR #1622766, NIH/NIA SBIR R43-AG056250, R44-AG056250), received honoraria/travel support for lectures from Boston University, Boston College, Tufts School of Dental Medicine, New York University, Eric H. Angle Society of Orthodontists, University of Miami, University of South Florida, University of Utah, University of Arizona, and Allstate, consulting for SleepNumber, and receives an honorarium for his role as the Editor in Chief of Sleep Health (sleephealthjournal.org). Outside of the current work, Anne-Marie Chang and Margeaux M. Schade have received a grant to Penn State from Kunasan, Inc. Anne-Marie Chang has also received honoraria/travel support for lectures from the University of Miami.

## Figures

**Figure 1.. Visualization of the 11-day Sleep Restriction Study protocol.**

Black bars represent the sleep opportunity interval in three different conditions: Ten hours (22:00-08:00) for three nights during the baseline condition (BL), followed by five hours (00:30-05:30) for five nights during the sleep restriction condition (SR), and ten hours (22:00-08:00) for two nights during the recovery condition (REC). Heart symbols denote approximately when heart rate and blood pressure were measured throughout the day. Solid black lines denote approximate overlap with blood collection and intravenous glucose tolerance test procedure.

**Figure 2.. Heart rate (A), systolic blood pressure (B), and diastolic blood pressure (C) across the study.**

Black lines show person-weighted mean cardiac activity on each day of the study (A-C) and predicted cardiac activity on each day of the study at 12:00 after accounting for wake-centered time and clocktime <sup>2</sup> (Model 5) across the study (D-E). Dotted lines show standard error of the mean. Note. SR = Sleep restriction, REC = Recovery
